@majorheading Description

Determine whether the C compiler supports C tentative definitions. See
K&R book Appendix A10.2 on 'extern' and tentative definitions. Some
compilers use a 'strict definition-reference model' Traditionally most
UNIX C compilers support tentative definitions, whereas some compiler
such as Metrowerks or WATCOM C do not.

The $ac_cv_tentdef variable will be either no or yes, and can be
overridden on the command line using --with-tentdef

See also:  ax_cc_attrcommon.m4 for a __attribute__(( __common__)) test
