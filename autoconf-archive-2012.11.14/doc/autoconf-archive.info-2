ax_compute_relative_paths
=========================

Synopsis
********

     AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS(PATH_LIST)

Description
***********

PATH_LIST is a space-separated list of colon-separated triplets of the
form 'FROM:TO:RESULT'. This function iterates over these triplets and
set $RESULT to the relative path from $FROM to $TO. Note that $FROM and
$TO needs to be absolute filenames for this macro to success.

For instance,

       first=/usr/local/bin
       second=/usr/local/share
       AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS([first:second:fs second:first:sf])
       # $fs is set to ../share
       # $sf is set to ../bin

$FROM and $TO are both eval'ed recursively and normalized, this means
that you can call this macro with autoconf's dirnames like `prefix' or
`datadir'. For example:

       AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS([bindir:datadir:bin_to_data])

AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS should also works with DOS filenames.

You may want to use this macro in order to make your package
relocatable. Instead of hardcoding $datadir into your programs just
encode $bin_to_data and try to determine $bindir at run-time.

This macro requires AX_NORMALIZE_PATH.

ax_compute_standard_relative_paths
==================================

Synopsis
********

     AX_COMPUTE_STANDARD_RELATIVE_PATHS

Description
***********

Here is the standard hierarchy of paths, as defined by the GNU Coding
Standards:

       prefix
          exec_prefix
             bindir
             libdir
             libexecdir
             sbindir
          datadir
          sysconfdir
          sharestatedir
          localstatedir
          infodir
          lispdir
          includedir
          oldincludedir
          mandir

This macro will setup a set of variables of the form
'xxx_forward_relative_path' and 'xxx_backward_relative_path' where xxx
is one of the above directories. The latter variable is set to the
relative path to go from xxx to its parent directory, while the former
hold the other way.

For instance `bindir_relative_path' will contains the value to add to
$exec_prefix to reach the $bindir directory (usually 'bin'), and
`bindir_backward_relative_path' the value to append to $bindir to reach
the $exec_prefix directory (usually '..').

This macro requires AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS which itself requires
AX_NORMALIZE_PATH.

ax_cond_with_level
==================

Synopsis
********

     AX_COND_WITH_LEVEL(PACKAGE [,DEFAULT [,YESLEVEL]])

Description
***********

Actually used after an AC_ARG_WITH(PKG,...) option-directive, where
AC_ARG_WITH is a part of the standard autoconf to define a `configure`
-with-PKG option.

This macros works almost like AC_COND_WITH(PACKAGE [,DEFAULT]), but the
definition is set to a numeric value. The level of a simple "yes" is
given (or assumed "2" if absent), otherwise the level can be given in
mnemonic names, being:

      1 = some
      2 = many
      3 = all
      4 = extra
      5 = extrasome more
      6 = extramany muchmore much
      7 = super everything
      8 = ultra experimental
      9 = insane

this macro is most handily it making Makefile.in/Makefile.am that have a
set of with-level declarations, espcially optimization-levels

the $withval shell-variable is set for further examination (it carries
the numeric value of the various mnemonics above)

=================

Synopsis
********

     AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(FEATURE-NAME, FEATURE-DESCRIPTION, DEFINE, DEFINE-DESCRIPTION, [ACTION-IF-ENABLED [, ACTION-IF-NOT-ENABLED]])

Description
***********

AX_CONFIG_FEATURE is a simple wrapper for AC_ARG_ENABLE, it enables the
feature FEATURE-NAME and AC_DEFINEs the passed DEFINE, depending on the
user choice. DESCRIPTION will be used for AC_DEFINEs. ACTION-IF-ENABLED
and ACTION-IF-NOT-ENABLED are the actions that will be run. A feature is
enabled by default, in order to change this behaviour use the
AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLED and AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_DISABLED
macros.

A simple example:

       AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLED
       AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(feature_xxxxx, [turns on/off XXXXX support],
                         HAVE_XXXXX, [Define if you want XXXXX support])

       ...

       AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_DISABLED
       AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(feature_yyyyy, [turns on/off YYYYY support],
                         HAVE_YYYYY, [Define if you want YYYYY support],
                         [enable_yyyyy="yes"], [enable_yyyyy="no"])
       AM_CONDITIONAL(YYYYY, [test "$enable_yyyyy" = "yes"])

       AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLED
       AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(...)

       ...

If you have lot of features and you want a verbose dumping of each user
selection use AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE. Use AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SILENT in
order to remove a previously AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE. By default
features are silent.

Use AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ENABLE or AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DISABLE in order to
enable or disable a specific feature.

Another simple example:

       AS_IF([some_test_here],[AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ENABLE(feature_xxxxx)],[])

       AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(feature_xxxxx, [turns on/off XXXXX support],
                         HAVE_XXXXX, [Define if you want XXXXX support])
       AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(feature_yyyyy, [turns on/off YYYYY support],
                         HAVE_YYYYY, [Define if you want YYYYY support],
                         [enable_yyyyy="yes"], [enable_yyyyy="no"])

       ...

NOTE: AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ENABLE() must be placed first of the relative
AX_CONFIG_FEATURE() macro ...

ax_configure_args
=================

Synopsis
********

     AX_CONFIGURE_ARGS

Description
***********

Helper macro for AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR.

The traditional way of starting a subdir-configure is running the script
with ${1+"$@"} but since autoconf 2.60 this is broken. Instead we have
to rely on eval'ing $ac_configure_args however some old autoconf
versions do not provide that. To ensure maximum portability of autoconf
extension macros this helper can be AC_REQUIRE'd so that
$ac_configure_args will alsways be present.

Sadly, the traditional "exec $SHELL" of the enable_builddir macros is
spoiled now and must be replaced by "eval + exit $?".

Example:

       AC_DEFUN([AX_ENABLE_SUBDIR],[dnl
         AC_REQUIRE([AX_CONFIGURE_ARGS])dnl
         eval $SHELL $ac_configure_args || exit $?
         ...])

     AX_CREATE_GENERIC_CONFIG [(PACKAGEnlibs [, VERSION])]

Description
***********

Creates a generic PACKAGE-config file that has all the things that you
want, hmm, well, atleast it has -cflags, -version, -libs. Ahhm, did you
see ax_path_generic in the autoconf-archive? ;-)

this macros saves you all the typing for a pkg-config.in script, you
don't even need to distribute one along. Place this macro in your
configure.ac, et voila, you got one that you want to install.

oh, btw, if the first arg looks like "mylib -lwhat' then it will go to
be added to the -libs, and mylib is extracted.

the defaults: $1 = $PACKAGE $LIBS $2 = $VERSION there is also an
AC_SUBST(GENERIC_CONFIG) that will be set to the name of the file that
we did output in this macro. Use as:

      install-exec-local:    install-generic-config

      install-generic-config:
         $(mkinstalldirs) $(DESTDIR)$(bindir)
         $(INSTALL_SCRIPT) @GENERIC_CONFIG@ $(DESTDIR)$(bindir)

     AX_CREATE_PKGCONFIG_INFO [(outputfile, [requires [,libs [,summary [,cflags [, ldflags]]]]])]

Description
***********

Defaults:

       $1 = $PACKAGE_NAME.pc
       $2 = (empty)
       $3 = $PACKAGE_LIBS $LIBS (as set at that point in configure.ac)
       $4 = $PACKAGE_SUMMARY (or $1 Library)
       $5 = $PACKAGE_CFLAGS (as set at the point in configure.ac)
       $6 = $PACKAGE_LDFLAGS (as set at the point in configure.ac)

       PACKAGE_NAME defaults to $PACKAGE if not set.
       PACKAGE_LIBS defaults to -l$PACKAGE_NAME if not set.

The resulting file is called $PACKAGE.pc.in / $PACKAGE.pc

You will find this macro most useful in conjunction with
ax_spec_defaults that can read good initializers from the .spec file. In
consequencd, most of the generatable installable stuff can be made from
information being updated in a single place for the whole project.

ax_create_stdint_h
==================

Synopsis
********

     AX_CREATE_STDINT_H [( HEADER-TO-GENERATE [, HEDERS-TO-CHECK])]

Description
***********

the "ISO C9X: 7.18 Integer types <stdint.h>" section requires the
existence of an include file <stdint.h> that defines a set of typedefs,
especially uint8_t,int32_t,uintptr_t. Many older installations will not
provide this file, but some will have the very same definitions in
<inttypes.h>. In other enviroments we can use the inet-types in
<sys/types.h> which would define the typedefs int8_t and u_int8_t
respectivly.

This macros will create a local "_stdint.h" or the headerfile given as
an argument. In many cases that file will just "#include <stdint.h>" or
"#include <inttypes.h>", while in other environments it will provide the
set of basic 'stdint's definitions/typedefs:

       int8_t,uint8_t,int16_t,uint16_t,int32_t,uint32_t,intptr_t,uintptr_t
       int_least32_t.. int_fast32_t.. intmax_t

which may or may not rely on the definitions of other files, or using
the AC_CHECK_SIZEOF macro to determine the actual sizeof each type.

if your header files require the stdint-types you will want to create an
installable file mylib-int.h that all your other installable header may
include. So if you have a library package named "mylib", just use

       AX_CREATE_STDINT_H(mylib-int.h)

in configure.ac and go to install that very header file in Makefile.am
along with the other headers (mylib.h) - and the mylib-specific headers
can simply use "#include <mylib-int.h>" to obtain the stdint-types.

Remember, if the system already had a valid <stdint.h>, the generated
file will include it directly. No need for fuzzy HAVE_STDINT_H things...
(oops, GCC 4.2.x has deliberatly disabled its stdint.h for non-c99
compilation and the c99-mode is not the default. Therefore this macro
will not use the compiler's stdint.h - please complain to the GCC
developers).

ax_create_target_h
==================

Synopsis
********

     AX_CREATE_TARGET_H [(HEADER-FILE [,PREFIX)]

Description
***********

Create the header-file and let it contain '#defines' for the target
platform. This macro is used for libraries that have platform-specific
quirks. Instead of inventing a target-specific target.h.in files, just
let it create a header file from the definitions of AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM
and put only ifdef's in the installed header-files.

      if the HEADER-FILE is absent, [target.h] is used.
      if the PREFIX is absent, [TARGET] is used.
      the prefix can be the packagename. (y:a-z-:A-Z_:)

The defines look like...

      #ifndef TARGET_CPU_M68K
      #define TARGET_CPU_M68K "m68k"
      #endif

      #ifndef TARGET_OS_LINUX
      #define TARGET_OS_LINUX "linux-gnu"
      #endif

      #ifndef TARGET_OS_TYPE                     /* the string itself */
      #define TARGET_OS_TYPE "linux-gnu"
      #endif

Detail: in the case of hppa1.1, the three idents "hppa1_1" "hppa1" and
"hppa" are derived, for an m68k it just two, "m68k" and "m".

The CREATE_TARGET_H__ variant is almost the same function, but
everything is lowercased instead of uppercased, and there is a "__" in
front of each prefix, so it looks like...

      #ifndef __target_os_linux
      #define __target_os_linux "linux-gnulibc2"
      #endif

      #ifndef __target_os__                     /* the string itself */
      #define __target_os__ "linux-gnulibc2"
      #endif

      #ifndef __target_cpu_i586
      #define __target_cpu_i586 "i586"
      #endif

      #ifndef __target_arch_i386
      #define __target_arch_i386 "i386"
      #endif

      #ifndef __target_arch__                   /* cpu family arch */
      #define __target_arch__ "i386"
      #endif

Other differences: the default string-define is "__" instead of "_TYPE".

Personally, I prefer the second variant (which had been the first in the
devprocess of this file but I assume people will often fallback to the
primary variant presented herein).

NOTE: CREATE_TARGET_H does also fill HOST_OS-defines Functionality has
been split over functions called CREATE_TARGET_H_UPPER,
CREATE_TARGET_H_LOWER, CREATE_TARGET_HOST_UPPER, and
CREATE_TARGET_HOST_LOWER.

      CREATE_TARGET_H  uses CREATE_TARGET_H_UPPER CREATE_TARGET_HOST_UPPER
      CREATE_TARGET_H_ uses CREATE_TARGET_H_LOWER CREATE_TARGET_HOST_LOWER

There is now a CREATE_PREFIX_TARGET_H in this file as a shorthand for
PREFIX_CONFIG_H from a target.h file, however w/o the target.h ever
created (the prefix is a bit different, since we add an extra -target-
and -host-).

Synopsis
********

     AX_CVS([ANON_CVSROOT])

Description
***********

Adds support cvs targets within your Makefile.

Branching and releasing relies on you using the following version
format:

       MAJOR.MINOR.POINT

where MAJOR is the major version number, MINOR is the minor version
number and POINT is the point release number.

make update

       performs a cvs update

make commitlog

       Generates a ChangeLog template with the modifed, added
       and removed files and opens it up for editing. This is
       not normally used directly, but is instad called by
       commit. It is usefull however if you want to document
       the work you have done, but don't want to commit just
       yet.

make commit

       performs a cvs commit after first performing a cvs
       update and generating a commit log.

make cvs-rm FILES="file1 file2 ..."

       removes a file or files specified by the FILES
       variable from the file system and from cvs. It will
       interactively ask you to confirm the file removal,
       unless the file does not exist on the file system.

make cvs-add FILES="file1 file2 ..."

       adds a file or files specified by the FILES variable
       to cvs.

make branch-major

       creates a branch based on the major version number,
       increments the major version number, sets the minor
       and point versions to zero and checks out the branch
       into a new directory.

make branch-minor

       creates a branch based on the minor version number,
       increments the minor version, sets the point version
       to zero number and checks out the branch into a new
       directory.

make release

       performs a cvs update, followed by a distcheck, then
       creates a release for the current version, increaments
       the point release number and checks out the release
       into a new direcory

make quick-release

       same as release, but distcheck is not performed

Check whether the C++11 '= delete' syntax, for suppressing undesired

can write

       class foo {
         ...
       private:
         foo(foo const&) DELETE_METHOD;
       };

to delete the 'foo' copy constructor or fall back to the idiom of a
private undefined method if the compiler doesn't support this.

Does not test '= delete' on a template specialization. Does not ensure
that the compiler is in C++11 mode.

Append to LD-FLAGS the set of link-time flags that should be passed to
the C++ compiler in order to enable use of C++ features as defined in
the ANSI C++ standard (eg. use of standard iostream classes in the `std'
namespace, etc.). Note that if you use GNU Libtool you may need to
prefix each of those switches with `-Xlinker' so that Libtool doesn't
discard them (see Libtool's manual and `AC_LIBTOOLIZE_LDFLAGS').

     AX_CXX_VERBOSE_TERMINATE_HANDLER

Description
***********

Check if the terminate handler for the current compiler/standard library
prints useful information to stdout/stderr (i.e. the type of the
uncaught exception and/or the what() string).

The intended use case for this check is to help program authors decide
if they need to add a top-level try-catch or custom terminate handler to
print useful information if an uncaught exception occurs, or if this
task can be left to the standard library implementation. Alternatively,
it can be used to detect if such output needs to be silenced with a
custom terminate handler.

Output:

Define HAVE_VERBOSE_TERMINATE_HANDLER if useful information is printed.

Synopsis

     AX_DEFINE_INTEGER_BITS (TYPE [, CANDIDATE-TYPE]...)

Description
***********

Given a TYPE of the form "int##_t" or "uint##_t", see if the datatype
TYPE is predefined. If not, then define TYPE - both with AC_DEFINE and
as a shell variable - to the first datatype of exactly ## bits in a
list of CANDIDATE-TYPEs. If none of the CANDIDATE-TYPEs contains exactly
## bits, then set the TYPE shell variable to "no".

For example, the following ensures that uint64_t is defined as a 64-bit
datatype:

       AX_DEFINE_INTEGER_BITS(uint64_t, unsigned long long, unsigned __int64, long)
       if test "$uint64_t" = no; then
         AC_MSG_ERROR([unable to continue without a 64-bit datatype])
       fi

You should then put the following in your C code to ensure that all
datatypes defined by AX_DEFINE_INTEGER_BITS are visible to your program:

       #include "config.h"

       #if HAVE_INTTYPES_H
       # include <inttypes.h>
       #else
       # if HAVE_STDINT_H
       #  include <stdint.h>
       # endif

ax_define_sub_path
==================

Synopsis
********

     AX_DEFINE_SUB_PATH(DEFNAME, varname, description)

Description
***********

Look at varname and detect the subpath that it contains relative to
$prefix/$exec_prefix. If the path is indeed relative to
$prefix/$exec_prefix, then a single "./" (dotslash) is prepended,
otherwise it can be seen as an absolute path that cannot be moved, which
you possibly do for "/etc" files, or even those ending up in
"/lib/modules" or "/winnt/system".

This macro is not very intelligent, it's just a first try in this
direction. It does currently just look into the current patterns, and
replaces a ${prefix} with a simple dot. Amazingly, it works quite well
for most packages.

Example (configure.ac):

       AX_DEFINE_DIR([EPREFIX], [exec_prefix], [--exec-prefix or default])
       AX_DEFINE_SUB_PATH([PATH_LIBDIR], [libdir], [--bindir subdir])
       AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED([PACKAGE],"$PACKAGE", [Name of package])

Example (in C):

       static const char _libdir[] = PATH_LIBDIR; /* configure default */
       char* libdir;
       char* eprefix = getenv (PACKAGE "DIR");
       if (! eprefix) eprefix = EPREFIX; /* default */
       if (*_libdir != '.') libdir = strdup(_libdir);
       else {
          libdir = malloc(strlen(eprefix) + strlen(_libdir) + 2);
          strcpy(libdir, eprefix);
          strcat(libdir, PATH_DELIMITER_STRING);
          strcat(libdir, _libdir);
       }
       ...
       free (libdir);

The AX_DEFINE_SUB_PATHS(varnames) macro looks for the given various
install-paths that largely depend on either ${prefix} or ${exec_prefix}.
Just cut out the prefix and ac_define the value. The value is uppercased
and PATH_ prepended ie. ax_define_sub_paths(bindir libdir pkgdatadir)
will create the defines PATH_BINDIR PATH_LIBDIR PATH_PKGDATADIR - see
posix' include/paths.h that creates _PATH_DEV and friends.

Synopsis

     AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR [(dirstring-or-command [,Makefile.mk [,-all]])]

Description
***********

If the current configure was run within the srcdir then we move all
configure-files into a subdir and let the configure steps continue
there. We provide an option -disable-builddir to suppress the move into
a separate builddir.

Defaults:

       $1 = $host (overridden with $HOST)
       $2 = Makefile.mk
       $3 = -all

This macro must be called before AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE. It creates a default
toplevel srcdir Makefile from the information found in the created
toplevel builddir Makefile. It just copies the variables and
rule-targets, each extended with a default rule-execution that recurses
into the build directory of the current "HOST". You can override the
auto-dection through `config.guess` and build-time of course, as in

       make HOST=i386-mingw-cross

which can of course set at configure time as well using

       configure --host=i386-mingw-cross

After the default has been created, additional rules can be appended
that will not just recurse into the subdirectories and only ever exist
in the srcdir toplevel makefile - these parts are read from the $2 =
Makefile.mk file

The automatic rules are usually scanning the toplevel Makefile for lines
like '#### $host |$builddir' to recognize the place where to recurse
into. Usually, the last one is the only one used. However, almost all
targets have an additional "*-all" rule which makes the script to
recurse into _all_ variants of the current HOST (!!) setting. The "-all"
suffix can be overriden for the macro as well.

a special rule is only given for things like "dist" that will copy the
tarball from the builddir to the sourcedir (or $(PUB)) for reason of
convenience.

Synopsis
********

     AX_EXPAND_PREFIX

Description
***********

When $prefix and $exec_prefix are still set to NONE then set them to the
usual default values - being based on $ac_default_prefix. - this macro
can be AC_REQUIREd by other macros that need to compute values for
installation directories. It has been observed that it was done wrong
over and over again, so this is a bit more safe to do.

remember - setting exec_prefix='${prefix}' needs you interpolate
directories multiple times, it is not sufficient to just say
MYVAR="${datadir}/putter" but you do have to run `eval` a few times,
sth. like MYVAR=`eval "echo \"$MYVAR\""` done atleast two times.

The implementation of this macro simply picks up the lines that would be
run at the start of AC_OUTPUT anyway to set the prefix/exec_prefix
defaults. Between AC_INIT and the first command to AC_REQUIRE this macro
you can set the two variables to something explicit instead. Probably,
any command to compute installation directories should be run _after_
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE

     AX_EXT

Description
***********

Find supported SIMD extensions by requesting cpuid. When an SIMD
extension is found, the -m"simdextensionname" is added to SIMD_FLAGS
(only if compilator support it) (ie : if "sse2" is available "-msse2" is
added to SIMD_FLAGS)

This macro calls:

       AC_SUBST(SIMD_FLAGS)

And defines:

       HAVE_MMX / HAVE_SSE / HAVE_SSE2 / HAVE_SSE3 / HAVE_SSSE3 /
       HAVE_SSE41 / HAVE_SSE42 / HAVE_AVX

     AX_EXT_CHECK_HEADER(<header>, <paths>).

Description
***********

Check for <header> with -I<path> for each path in <paths> if need be.
The first sucecssful path is chosen (eg if you say
AX_EXT_CHECK_HEADER(foo.h, bar baz qux) and -Ibaz works then -Iqux will
not be tested.

Any -I flags that locate a header are added to CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS. AS
with AC_CHECK_HEADERS it causes HAVE_<header>_H to be defined as 1.

Example:

      AX_EXT_HAVE_HEADER(openssl/rsa.h, /usr/local/include /usr/local/ssl/include /usr/local/openssl/include)

Synopsis
********

     AX_EXT_HAVE_LIB(<directories>, <library>, <function>, <extra libraries>)

Description
***********

AX_EXT_HAVE_LIB is identical to AC_SEARCH_LIBS with the exception that
will add -L<directory> when looking, and use a different variable for
each directory.

Any required -L<directory> flags are added to LDFLAGS and located
libraies are added to LIBS

Some libraries are unlinkable without other extra libraries, which can
be specified in the 4th argument. The mysql client library needs -lz,
for example.

Example:

      AX_EXT_HAVE_LIB(/lib /usr/lib /usr/local/lib /usr/lib/mysql /usr/local/mysql/lib, mysqlclient, mysql_init, [-lz])

which finds the mysql client library if succeds system when it tries
with -L/usr/lib/mysql then it adds -lmysqlclient to LIBS and
-L/usr/lib/mysql to LDFLAGS.

The test itself is based on the autoconf 2.53 version of AC_SEARCH_LIBS.

Description
***********

Allow support for custom dist targets.

To add custom dist targets, you must create a dist-<TYPE> target within
your Makefile.am, where <TYPE> is the name of the dist and then add
<TYPE> to EXTRA_SRC_DISTS or EXTRA_BIN_DISTS. For example:

       dist-foobar:
        <rules for making the foobar dist>

       EXTRA_BIN_DISTS += foobar

You can then build all the src dist targets by running:

       make dist-src

You can build all the binary dist targets by running:

       make dist-bin

and you can build both the src and dist targets by running:

       make all-dist

===================

Synopsis
********

     AX_F77_CMAIN_FFLAGS([ACTION-IF-SUCCEED], [ACTION-IF-FAIL])

Description
***********

This macro figures out if extra Fortran compiler flags are required in
order to use the Fortran linker to link programs where the main()
function is defined via C (or other language). On some systems, notably
the Alpha with Compaq compilers, the Fortran libraries have their own
main() function which must be disabled.

Runs ACTION-IF-SUCCEED if successful, and ACTION-IF-FAIL if not. Defines
the output variable F77_CMAIN_FFLAGS to any discovered flags. (If
ACTION-IF-FAIL is not specified, defaults to halting with an error.)

This macro is especially useful in conjunction with automake, since by
default automake uses $F77 to link programs mixing C and Fortran,
leading to a link error on some systems. In this case, you should set
the FFLAGS for that program to include F77_CMAIN_FFLAGS.

directories that will be recursively searched for header files. If
empty, the search path will be composed of $prefix, $ac_default_prefix,
and all directories exactly one level *above* the directories in
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH (the rationale is that when libraries are put in
/some/path/lib, the headers are often put in a directory like
/some/path/include). An output variable named F90_HEADER_xxx will be set
up with the proper flag for substitution in Makefiles (xxx is built from
the first argument, with autoconf traditional escapes).

     AX_F90_LIBRARY_SETUP(LIBRARY, HEADER-REGEXP, MODULE-REGEXP, LIB-REGEXP, FUNCTION-BODY)

Description
***********

Convenience macro to set up a fortran 90 library in a simplified way.
LIBRARY is the name of the library. HEADER-REGEXP is a regular
expression (used by find) matched by the header file to look for (may be
empty). MODULE-REGEXP is a regular expression (used by find) matched by
the filename of the module (may be empty). LIB-REGEXP is a regular
expression (used by find) matched by the filename of the library, this
is useful either if the library filename does not follow the traditional
libxxx.a or libxxx.so pattern, or if some specific information is
embedded into the name, like compiler used, debugging status ...).
FUNCTION-BODY is the body of a function (including the 'use' statements
and the call to a function defined by the library).

This macro is a simple wrapper around AX_F90_MODULE and AX_F90_LIBRARY
that uses the parameters provided by the end user through a -with-xxx
option to set up the search path. Both a module and a library will be
tested, the same path will be used for both tests, so the path must be
set up with a common parent directory of both the library file and the
module file. The macro also automatically updates the FCFLAGS, LDFLAGS
and LIBS variables in addition to providing the F90_HEADER_xxx,
F90_MODULE_xxx, F90_LDFLAGS_xxx and F90_LIBS_xxx output variables.

Example: suppose you have /home/nostradamus/esoteric/lib/libalchemy.a
and /home/nostradamus/esoteric/mod/alchemy.mod which provides a function
transmute_into_gold, you can use the following in you configure.ac:

       AX_F90_MODULE_EXTENSION
       if test x$ax_cv_f90_modext = xunknown ; then
         AC_MSG_ERROR([unable to find f90 modules extension])
       fi
       AX_F90_LIBRARY_SETUP(alchemy,[],alchemy.$ax_cv_f90_modext,libalchemy*,[
          use alchemy
          call transmute_into_gold('lead')
         ])

and the user could configure your package using a command like this:

       ./configure --with-alchemy=$HOME/esoteric

     AX_FUNC_GETOPT_LONG

Description
***********

Check for getopt_long support.

This assume that the standard getopt.h file (from GNU libc) is available
as lib/gnugetopt.h. If needed, this file will be linked as getopt.h, but
we want to default to the system's getopt.h file. (See
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/automake/2000-09/msg00041.html for an
explanation about why using the system's getopt.h file is important.)

     AX_FUNC_WHICH_GETHOSTBYNAME_R

Description
***********

Determines which historical variant of the gethostbyname_r() call
(taking three, five, or six arguments) is available on the system and
defines one of the following macros accordingly:

       HAVE_FUNC_GETHOSTBYNAME_R_6
       HAVE_FUNC_GETHOSTBYNAME_R_5
       HAVE_FUNC_GETHOSTBYNAME_R_3

as well as

       HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R

If used in conjunction with gethostname.c, the API demonstrated in
test.c can be used regardless of which gethostbyname_r() is available.
These example files can be found at
http://www.csn.ul.ie/~caolan/publink/gethostbyname_r

based on David Arnold's autoconf suggestion in the threads faq

Originally named "AC_caolan_FUNC_WHICH_GETHOSTBYNAME_R". Rewritten for
Autoconf 2.5x, and updated for 2.68 by Daniel Richard G.

ax_gcc_archflag
===============

Synopsis
********

     AX_GCC_ARCHFLAG([PORTABLE?], [ACTION-SUCCESS], [ACTION-FAILURE])

Description
***********

This macro tries to guess the "native" arch corresponding to the target
architecture for use with gcc's -march=arch or -mtune=arch flags. If
found, the cache variable $ax_cv_gcc_archflag is set to this flag and
ACTION-SUCCESS is executed; otherwise $ax_cv_gcc_archflag is set to
"unknown" and ACTION-FAILURE is executed. The default ACTION-SUCCESS is
to add $ax_cv_gcc_archflag to the end of $CFLAGS.

PORTABLE? should be either [yes] (default) or [no]. In the former case,
the flag is set to -mtune (or equivalent) so that the architecture is
only used for tuning, but the instruction set used is still portable. In
the latter case, the flag is set to -march (or equivalent) so that
architecture-specific instructions are enabled.

The user can specify -with-gcc-arch=<arch> in order to override the
macro's choice of architecture, or -without-gcc-arch to disable this.

When cross-compiling, or if $CC is not gcc, then ACTION-FAILURE is
called unless the user specified -with-gcc-arch manually.

Requires macros: AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG, AX_GCC_X86_CPUID

(The main emphasis here is on recent CPUs, on the principle that doing
high-performance computing on old hardware is uncommon.)

     AX_GCC_X86_CPUID(OP)

Description
***********

On Pentium and later x86 processors, with gcc or a compiler that has a
compatible syntax for inline assembly instructions, run a small program
that executes the cpuid instruction with input OP. This can be used to
detect the CPU type.

On output, the values of the eax, ebx, ecx, and edx registers are stored
as hexadecimal strings as "eax:ebx:ecx:edx" in the cache variable
ax_cv_gcc_x86_cpuid_OP.

If the cpuid instruction fails (because you are running a
cross-compiler, or because you are not using gcc, or because you are on
a processor that doesn't have this instruction), ax_cv_gcc_x86_cpuid_OP
is set to the string "unknown".

This macro mainly exists to be used in AX_GCC_ARCHFLAG.

     AX_HAVE_EPOLL([ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])
     AX_HAVE_EPOLL_PWAIT([ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])

Description
***********

This macro determines whether the system supports the epoll I/O event
interface. A neat usage example would be:

       AX_HAVE_EPOLL(
         [AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ENABLE(epoll)],
         [AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DISABLE(epoll)])
       AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(
         [epoll], [This platform supports epoll(7)],
         [HAVE_EPOLL], [This platform supports epoll(7).])

The epoll interface was added to the Linux kernel in version 2.5.45, and
the macro verifies that a kernel newer than this is installed. This
check is somewhat unreliable if <linux/version.h> doesn't match the
running kernel, but it is necessary regardless, because glibc comes with
stubs for the epoll_create(), epoll_wait(), etc. that allow programs to
compile and link even if the kernel is too old; the problem would then
be detected only at runtime.

Linux kernel version 2.6.19 adds the epoll_pwait() call in addition to
epoll_wait(). The availability of that function can be tested with the
second macro. Generally speaking, it is safe to assume that
AX_HAVE_EPOLL would succeed if AX_HAVE_EPOLL_PWAIT has, but not the
other way round.

Description
***********

Search for OpenGL. We search first for Mesa (a GPL'ed version of Mesa)
before a vendor's version of OpenGL, unless we were specifically asked
not to with `-with-Mesa=no' or `-without-Mesa'.

The four "standard" OpenGL libraries are searched for: "-lGL", "-lGLU",
"-lGLX" (or "-lMesaGL", "-lMesaGLU" as the case may be) and "-lglut".

All of the libraries that are found (since "-lglut" or "-lGLX" might be
missing) are added to the shell output variable "GL_LIBS", along with
any other libraries that are necessary to successfully link an OpenGL
application (e.g. the X11 libraries). Care has been taken to make sure
that all of the libraries in "GL_LIBS" are listed in the proper order.

Additionally, the shell output variable "GL_CFLAGS" is set to any flags
(e.g. "-I" flags) that are necessary to successfully compile an OpenGL
application.

The following shell variable (which are not output variables) are also
set to either "yes" or "no" (depending on which libraries were found) to
help you determine exactly what was found.

       have_GL
       have_GLU
       have_GLX
       have_glut

Description
***********

Searches common directories for Qt include files, libraries and Qt
binary utilities. The macro supports several different versions of the
Qt framework being installed on the same machine. Without options, the
macro is designed to look for the latest library, i.e., the highest
definition of QT_VERSION in qglobal.h. By use of one or more options a
different library may be selected. There are two different sets of
options. Both sets contain the option -with-Qt-lib=LIB which can be
used to force the use of a particular version of the library file when
more than one are available. LIB must be in the form as it would appear
behind the "-l" option to the compiler. Examples for LIB would be
"qt-mt" for the multi-threaded version and "qt" for the regular version.
In addition to this, the first set consists of an option
-with-Qt-dir=DIR which can be used when the installation conforms to
Trolltech's standard installation, which means that header files are in
DIR/include, binary utilities are in DIR/bin and the library is in
DIR/lib. The second set of options can be used to indicate individual
locations for the header files, the binary utilities and the library
file, in addition to the specific version of the library file.

The following shell variable is set to either "yes" or "no":

       have_qt

Additionally, the following variables are exported:

       QT_CXXFLAGS
       QT_LIBS
       QT_MOC
       QT_UIC
       QT_LRELEASE
       QT_LUPDATE
       QT_DIR

which respectively contain an "-I" flag pointing to the Qt include
directory (and "-DQT_THREAD_SUPPORT" when LIB is "qt-mt"), link flags
necessary to link with Qt and X, the name of the meta object compiler
and the user interface compiler both with full path, and finaly the
variable QTDIR as Trolltech likes to see it defined (if possible).

Example lines for Makefile.in:

       CXXFLAGS = @QT_CXXFLAGS@
       MOC      = @QT_MOC@

After the variables have been set, a trial compile and link is performed
to check the correct functioning of the meta object compiler. This test
may fail when the different detected elements stem from different
releases of the Qt framework. In that case, an error message is emitted
and configure stops.

No common variables such as $LIBS or $CFLAGS are polluted.

Options:

-with-Qt-dir=DIR: DIR is equal to $QTDIR if you have followed the
installation instructions of Trolltech. Header files are in DIR/include,
binary utilities are in DIR/bin and the library is in DIR/lib.

-with-Qt-include-dir=DIR: Qt header files are in DIR.

-with-Qt-bin-dir=DIR: Qt utilities such as moc and uic are in DIR.

-with-Qt-lib-dir=DIR: The Qt library is in DIR.

-with-Qt-lib=LIB: Use -lLIB to link with the Qt library.

If some option "=no" or, equivalently, a -without-Qt-* version is given
in stead of a -with-Qt-*, "have_qt" is set to "no" and the other
variables are set to the empty string.

Description

Test if a Java class is available. Based on AX_PROG_JAVAC_WORKS. This
version uses a cache variable which is both compiler, options and
classpath dependent (so if you switch from javac to gcj it correctly
notices and redoes the test).

The macro tries to compile a minimal program importing <class>. Some
newer compilers moan about the failure to use this but fail or produce a
class file anyway. All moaing is sunk to /dev/null since I only wanted
to know if the class could be imported. This is a recommended followup
to AX_CHECK_JAVA_PLUGIN with classpath appropriately adjusted.

     AX_JAVA_OPTIONS

Description
***********

AX_JAVA_OPTIONS adds configure command line options used for Java m4
macros. This Macro is optional.

Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set, some macros depend
on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission. The
general documentation, as well as the sample configure.in, is included
in the AX_PROG_JAVA macro.

==================

Synopsis
********

     AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR

Description
***********

AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR finds include directories needed for compiling
programs using the JNI interface.

JNI include directories are usually in the java distribution This is
deduced from the value of JAVAC. When this macro completes, a list of
directories is left in the variable JNI_INCLUDE_DIRS.

Example usage follows:

       AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR

       for JNI_INCLUDE_DIR in $JNI_INCLUDE_DIRS
       do
               CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I$JNI_INCLUDE_DIR"
       done

If you want to force a specific compiler:

- at the configure.in level, set JAVAC=yourcompiler before calling
AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR

- at the configure level, setenv JAVAC

Note: This macro can work with the autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
This particular macro is not part of the original set of macros.

ax_lapack
=========

Synopsis
********

     AX_LAPACK([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Description
***********

This macro looks for a library that implements the LAPACK linear-algebra
interface (see http://www.netlib.org/lapack/). On success, it sets the
LAPACK_LIBS output variable to hold the requisite library linkages.

To link with LAPACK, you should link with:

       $LAPACK_LIBS $BLAS_LIBS $LIBS $FLIBS

in that order. BLAS_LIBS is the output variable of the AX_BLAS macro,
called automatically. FLIBS is the output variable of the
AC_F77_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS macro (called if necessary by AX_BLAS), and is
sometimes necessary in order to link with F77 libraries. Users will also
need to use AC_F77_DUMMY_MAIN (see the autoconf manual), for the same
reason.

The user may also use -with-lapack=<lib> in order to use some specific
LAPACK library <lib>. In order to link successfully, however, be aware
that you will probably need to use the same Fortran compiler (which can
be set via the F77 env. var.) as was used to compile the LAPACK and BLAS
libraries.

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a LAPACK library
is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it
is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action
will define HAVE_LAPACK.

ax_lib_hdf5
===========

Synopsis
********

     AX_LIB_HDF5([serial/parallel])

Description
***********

This macro provides tests of the availability of HDF5 library.

The optional macro argument should be either 'serial' or 'parallel'. The
former only looks for serial HDF5 installations via h5cc. The latter
only looks for parallel HDF5 installations via h5pcc. If the optional
argument is omitted, serial installations will be preferred over
parallel ones.

The macro adds a -with-hdf5 option accepting one of three values:

       no   - do not check for the HDF5 library.
       yes  - do check for HDF5 library in standard locations.
       path - complete path to where lib/libhdf5* libraries and
              include/H5* include files reside.

If HDF5 is successfully found, this macro calls

       AC_SUBST(HDF5_VERSION)
       AC_SUBST(HDF5_CFLAGS)
       AC_SUBST(HDF5_CPPFLAGS)
       AC_SUBST(HDF5_LDFLAGS)
       AC_SUBST(HDF5_FFLAGS)
       AC_SUBST(HDF5_FLIBS)
       AC_DEFINE(HAVE_HDF5)

and sets with_hdf5="yes".  Additionally, the macro sets
with_hdf5_fortran="yes" if a matching Fortran wrapper script is found.
Note that Autconf's Fortran support is not used to perform this check.
H5CC and H5FC will contain the appropriate serial or parallel HDF5
wrapper script locations.

If HDF5 is disabled or not found, this macros sets with_hdf5="no" and
with_hdf5_fortran="no".

Your configuration script can test $with_hdf to take any further
actions. HDF5_{C,CPP,LD}FLAGS may be used when building with C or C++.
HDF5_F{FLAGS,LIBS} should be used when building Fortran applications.

To use the macro, one would code one of the following in "configure.ac"
before AC_OUTPUT:

       1) dnl Check for HDF5 support
          AX_LIB_HDF5()

       2) dnl Check for serial HDF5 support
          AX_LIB_HDF5([serial])

       3) dnl Check for parallel HDF5 support
          AX_LIB_HDF5([parallel])

One could test $with_hdf5 for the outcome or display it as follows

       echo "HDF5 support:  $with_hdf5"

Synopsis

     AX_LIB_METIS([ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])

Description
***********

This macro searches for the METIS library in the user specified
location. The user may specify the location either by defining the
environment variable METIS or by using the -with-metis option to
configure. If the environment variable is defined it has precedent over
everything else. If no location was specified then it searches in
/usr/lib and /usr/local/lib for the library and in /usr/include and
/usr/local/include for the header files. Upon sucessful completion the
variables METIS_LIB and METIS_INCLUDE are set.

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a METIS library is
found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it is
not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action will
define HAVE_METIS. If ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is not specified then an error
will be generated halting configure.

     AX_LIB_MYSQL([MINIMUM-VERSION])

Description
***********

This macro provides tests of availability of MySQL client library of
particular version or newer.

AX_LIB_MYSQL macro takes only one argument which is optional. If there
is no required version passed, then macro does not run version test.

The -with-mysql option takes one of three possible values:

no - do not check for MySQL client library

yes - do check for MySQL library in standard locations (mysql_config
should be in the PATH)

path - complete path to mysql_config utility, use this option if
mysql_config can't be found in the PATH

This macro calls:

       AC_SUBST(MYSQL_CFLAGS)
       AC_SUBST(MYSQL_LDFLAGS)
       AC_SUBST(MYSQL_VERSION)

And sets:

       HAVE_MYSQL

Synopsis

     AX_LIB_READLINE

Description
***********

Searches for a readline compatible library. If found, defines
`HAVE_LIBREADLINE'. If the found library has the `add_history' function,
sets also `HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY'. Also checks for the locations of the
necessary include files and sets `HAVE_READLINE_H' or
`HAVE_READLINE_READLINE_H' and `HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY_H' or
'HAVE_HISTORY_H' if the corresponding include files exists.

The libraries that may be readline compatible are `libedit',
`libeditline' and `libreadline'. Sometimes we need to link a termcap
library for readline to work, this macro tests these cases too by trying
to link with `libtermcap', `libcurses' or `libncurses' before giving up.

Here is an example of how to use the information provided by this macro
to perform the necessary includes or declarations in a C file:

       #ifdef HAVE_LIBREADLINE
       #  if defined(HAVE_READLINE_READLINE_H)
       #    include <readline/readline.h>
       #  elif defined(HAVE_READLINE_H)
       #    include <readline.h>
       #  else /* !defined(HAVE_READLINE_H) */
       extern char *readline ();
       #  endif /* !defined(HAVE_READLINE_H) */
       char *cmdline = NULL;
       #else /* !defined(HAVE_READLINE_READLINE_H) */

This macro figures out what libraries are required on this platform to
link sockets programs.

The common cases are not to need any extra libraries, or to need
-lsocket and -lnsl. We need to avoid linking with libnsl unless we need
it, though, since on some OSes where it isn't necessary it will totally
break networking. Unisys also includes gethostbyname() in libsocket but
needs libnsl for socket().

     AX_LUA_READLINE

Description
***********

Detect Lua interpreter, headers and libraries, optionally enforcing a
particular range of versions. If only one version is given, then exactly
this version is required.

AX_WITH_LUA searches for a Lua interpreter and defines LUA if found.

AX_PROG_LUA searches for a Lua interpreter in the given version range,
if any (at least MIN-VERSION and less than TOO-BIG-VERSION, if given),
and defines LUA if found, or stops with an error if not. Versions are
given in the same format as output by the Lua interpreter, and may be
just a prefix, e.g. "5.1.4", "5.2" or "5".

AX_LUA_HEADERS searches for Lua headers and defines HAVE_LUA_H and
HAVE_LUALIB_H if found, and defines LUA_INCLUDE to the preprocessor
flags needed, if any.

AX_LUA_HEADERS_VERSION checks that the Lua headers' version is at least
MIN-VERSION, and less than TOO-BIG-VERSION, if given. Versions are given
in the same format as LUA_VERSION_NUM in lua.h), e.g. 501 for Lua 5.1.
The revision (e.g. the "3" in "5.1.3") is ignored.

AX_LUA_LIBS searches for Lua libraries and defines LUA_LIB if found.

AX_LUA_READLINE configures Lua to be built with readline support, if
available. This macro requires AX_LIB_READLINE.

The following options are added by these macros:

       --with-lua-suffix=ARG     Lua binaries and library files are
                                 suffixed with ARG.

Synopsis

     AX_MAINTAINER_MODE_AUTO_SILENT

Description
***********

Set autotools to error/sleep settings so that they are not run when
being erroneously triggered. Likewise make libtool-silent when libtool
has been used.

I use the macro quite a lot since some automake versions have the
tendency to try to rerun some autotools on a mere make even when not
quite in -maintainer-mode. That is very annoying. Likewise, a user who
installs from source does not want to see doubled compiler messages.

I did not put an AC_REQUIRE(MAINTAINER_MODE) in here - should I?

Synopsis
********

     AX_MPI([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Description
***********

This macro tries to find out how to compile programs that use MPI
(Message Passing Interface), a standard API for parallel process
communication (see http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/)

On success, it sets the MPICC, MPICXX, MPIF77, or MPIFC output variable
to the name of the MPI compiler, depending upon the current language.
(This may just be $CC/$CXX/$F77/$FC, but is more often something like
mpicc/mpiCC/mpif77/mpif90.) It also sets MPILIBS to any libraries that
are needed for linking MPI (e.g. -lmpi or -lfmpi, if a special
MPICC/MPICXX/MPIF77/MPIFC was not found).

Note that this macro should be used only if you just have a few source
files that need to be compiled using MPI. In particular, you should
neither overwrite CC/CXX/F77/FC with the values of
MPICC/MPICXX/MPIF77/MPIFC, nor assume that you can use the same flags
etc. as the standard compilers. If you want to compile a whole program
using the MPI compiler commands, use one of the macros
AX_PROG_{CC,CXX,FC}_MPI.

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if an MPI library is
found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run if it is not
found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action will
define HAVE_MPI.
