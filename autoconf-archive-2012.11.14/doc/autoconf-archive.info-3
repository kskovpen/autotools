     AX_MPIP([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Description
***********

Test for mpiP: Lightweight, Scalable MPI Profiling
(http://mpip.sourceforge.net/)

Provides a -with-mpiP=DIR option. Searches -with-mpiP location and the
usual places for mpiP and required libraries.  Marks MPIP as a precious
environment variable.

On success, sets MPIP_LDFLAGS, MPIP_LIBS, #defines HAVE_MPIP, and calls
ACTION-IF-FOUND. When ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is not specified, the default
behavior is for configure to fail.

ax_normalize_path
=================

Synopsis
********

     AX_NORMALIZE_PATH(VARNAME, [REFERENCE_STRING])

Description
***********

Perform some cleanups on the value of $VARNAME (interpreted as a path):

       - empty paths are changed to '.'
       - trailing slashes are removed
       - repeated slashes are squeezed except a leading doubled slash '//'
         (which might indicate a networked disk on some OS).

REFERENCE_STRING is used to turn '/' into '\' and vice-versa: if
REFERENCE_STRING contains some backslashes, all slashes and backslashes
are turned into backslashes, otherwise they are all turned into slashes.

This makes processing of DOS filenames quite easier, because you can
turn a filename to the Unix notation, make your processing, and turn it
back to original notation.

       filename='A:\FOO\\BAR\'
       old_filename="$filename"
       # Switch to the unix notation
       AX_NORMALIZE_PATH([filename], ["/"])
       # now we have $filename = 'A:/FOO/BAR' and we can process it as if
       # it was a Unix path.  For instance let's say that you want
       # to append '/subpath':
       filename="$filename/subpath"
       # finally switch back to the original notation
       AX_NORMALIZE_PATH([filename], ["$old_filename"])
       # now $filename equals to 'A:\FOO\BAR\subpath'

One good reason to make all path processing with the unix convention is
that backslashes have a special meaning in many cases. For instance

       expr 'A:\FOO' : 'A:\Foo'

will return 0 because the second argument is a regex in which
backslashes have to be backslashed. In other words, to have the two
strings to match you should write this instead:

       expr 'A:\Foo' : 'A:\\Foo'

Such behavior makes DOS filenames extremely unpleasant to work with. So
temporary turn your paths to the Unix notation, and revert them to the
original notation after the processing. See the macro
AX_COMPUTE_RELATIVE_PATHS for a concrete example of this.

REFERENCE_STRING defaults to $VARIABLE, this means that slashes will be
converted to backslashes if $VARIABLE already contains some backslashes
(see $thirddir below).

       firstdir='/usr/local//share'
       seconddir='C:\Program Files\\'
       thirddir='C:\home/usr/'
       AX_NORMALIZE_PATH([firstdir])
       AX_NORMALIZE_PATH([seconddir])
       AX_NORMALIZE_PATH([thirddir])
       # $firstdir = '/usr/local/share'
       # $seconddir = 'C:\Program Files'
       # $thirddir = 'C:\home\usr'

=====================

Synopsis
********

     AX_NUMERIC_NAMEDLEVEL(VARNAME [,FROMVAR [,DEFAULT [,YESLEVEL]]])

Description
***********

The levelstring FROMVAR is expanded and checked for verbal names that
will map on to eight different levels - the VARNAME will receive this
numeric level where "all" maps to 7 (lower three bits set) higher levels
for 8 and 9 exist too. This macro is a nice helper to convert user input
of a -with-opt=level into a numeric form that can be simply pushed as a
#define like with AC_DEFINE:

      default YESLEVEL = 2 /* including unknown levelspec */
      default DEFAULT  = 0 /* when named level is empty */
      default FROMVAR  = VARNAME

The DEFAULT value is used if the NAMED levelstring has become empty and
it is copied without further conversion - a default of "0" is used if
absent - identical to "no". A "yes" will be set to the YESLEVEL - and
note that "yes" has "2" as its default value not "1". (which comes from
its original use to set a "gcc -O2").

the mnemonic names are:

       9| insane |ultrasome|experimentalplus
       8| ultra  |ultra|experimental)
       7| all    |muchmore|somemanymore|manymoreplus
       6| most   |manymore|most)
       5| strict |somemore|almost
       4| more   |more
       3| extra  |manyplus|plusmuch|somemany|plusmany
       2| many   |many|much|(yes)
       1| some   |some|plus

note that a level can be construcct of (some|plus) = bit-0, (many|much)
= bit-1, (more) = bit-2, (ultra|experimental) = bit-3 atleast in a
left-to-right order, ie. plusmanymore=7

Example usage:

       AX_NUMERIC_NAMEDLEVEL(OPTLEVEL,with_optlevel,1,3)
       AC_DEFINE(OPTLEVEL)
       test "$GCC" = "yes" && CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -O$OPTLEVEL)

ax_openmp
=========

Synopsis
********

     AX_OPENMP([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Description
***********

This macro tries to find out how to compile programs that use OpenMP a
standard API and set of compiler directives for parallel programming
(see http://www-unix.mcs/)

On success, it sets the OPENMP_CFLAGS/OPENMP_CXXFLAGS/OPENMP_F77FLAGS
output variable to the flag (e.g. -omp) used both to compile *and* link
OpenMP programs in the current language.

NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these flags,
but also link it with them as well.

If you want to compile everything with OpenMP, you should set:

       CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $OPENMP_CFLAGS"
       #OR#  CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS $OPENMP_CXXFLAGS"
       #OR#  FFLAGS="$FFLAGS $OPENMP_FFLAGS"

(depending on the selected language).

The user can override the default choice by setting the corresponding
environment variable (e.g. OPENMP_CFLAGS).

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if an OpenMP flag is
found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it is
not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action will
define HAVE_OPENMP.

ax_patch_libtool_changing_cmds_ifs
==================================

Synopsis
********

     AX_PATCH_LIBTOOL_CHANGING_CMDS_IFS

Description
***********

Do a `grep "^[a-z]*_cmds=" libtool` - these are "subroutines" encoded by
libtool.m4 into the generated libtool script. Since libtool assumes that
there is no subroutine-facility in the shell invoked, these are not
actually subroutines, but actually a "list of commands". This looks
correct, but the command separator is not ";" - it is "~", the tilde
character.

Now, grep again, look for `grep 'IFS="~"' libtool` and see that libtool
scripting uses a for-loop on the command-list, i.e for cmd in
$some_cmds. This works correctly when the IFS was modified, where IFS
stands for "input field separator" which is whitespace characters by
default.

The problem: I have some real-world filesystems where there are
directories using "~" inside of them, to be more to the point, it is a
change control management software that uses source repositories of the
form "path/master/project~version/src" and libtool has the tendency to
resolve any symlinks so that it will paste such path into the $_cmds
script when it gets evaluated a number of times.

This script is a workaround: I do not know why the ";" was not chosen as
the IFS, perhaps it has some weird interactions in some shells since it
is also the default record separator being one time bigger in context
than the argument separator. I have made good success however with using
"?" as the IFS, since there is no path-name that uses a question mark,
and there is no _cmds ever around that uses "?" for some thing.

Oh yes, there are some usages of "*" to match shell-wise at the output
file of some tool, so that might have triggered the choice to not use
"?" in the first place - but in real life it never occured that a _cmds
script was created that has gone to use "?". And so, this ac-macro
exchanges the s/~/?/g in configured _cmds variables and replaces all
occurences of s/IFS="~"/IFS="?"/ - and it all works smooth now.

ax_path_bdb
===========

Synopsis
********

     AX_PATH_BDB([MINIMUM-VERSION], [ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])

Description
***********

This macro finds the latest version of Berkeley DB on the system, and
ensures that the header file and library versions match. If
MINIMUM-VERSION is specified, it will ensure that the library found is
at least that version.

It determines the name of the library as well as the path to the header
file and library. It will check both the default environment as well as
the default Berkeley DB install location. When found, it sets BDB_LIBS,
BDB_CPPFLAGS, and BDB_LDFLAGS to the necessary values to add to LIBS,
CPPFLAGS, and LDFLAGS, as well as setting BDB_VERSION to the version
found. HAVE_DB_H is defined also.

The option -with-bdb-dir=DIR can be used to specify a specific Berkeley
DB installation to use.

An example of it's use is:

       AX_PATH_BDB([3],[
         LIBS="$BDB_LIBS $LIBS"
         LDFLAGS="$BDB_LDFLAGS $LDFLAGS"
         CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $BDB_CPPFLAGS"
       ])

which will locate the latest version of Berkeley DB on the system, and
ensure that it is version 3.0 or higher.

Details: This macro does not use either AC_CHECK_HEADERS or AC_CHECK_LIB
because, first, the functions inside the library are sometimes renamed
to contain a version code that is only available from the db.h on the
system, and second, because it is common to have multiple db.h and libdb
files on a system it is important to make sure the ones being used
correspond to the same version. Additionally, there are many different
possible names for libdb when installed by an OS distribution, and these
need to be checked if db.h does not correspond to libdb.

When cross compiling, only header versions are verified since it would
be difficult to check the library version. Additionally the default
Berkeley DB installation locations /usr/local/BerkeleyDB* are not
searched for higher versions of the library.

The format for the list of library names to search came from the Cyrus
IMAP distribution, although they are generated dynamically here, and
only for the version found in db.h.

The macro AX_COMPARE_VERSION is required to use this macro, and should
be available from the Autoconf Macro Archive.

The author would like to acknowledge the generous and valuable feedback
from Guido Draheim, without which this macro would be far less robust,
and have poor and inconsistent cross compilation support.

Changes:

      1/5/05 applied patch from Rafal Rzepecki to eliminate compiler
             warning about unused variable, argv

===============

Synopsis
********

     AX_PATH_GENERIC(LIBRARY,[MINIMUM-VERSION,[SED-EXPR-EXTRACTOR]],[ACTION-IF-FOUND],[ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND],[CONFIG-SCRIPTS],[CFLAGS-ARG],[LIBS-ARG])

Description
***********

Runs the LIBRARY-config script and defines LIBRARY_CFLAGS and
LIBRARY_LIBS unless the user had predefined them in the environment.

The script must support `-cflags' and `-libs' args. If MINIMUM-VERSION
is specified, the script must also support the `-version' arg. If the
`-with-library-[exec-]prefix' arguments to ./configure are given, it
must also support `-prefix' and `-exec-prefix'. Prefereable use
CONFIG-SCRIPTS as config script, CFLAGS-ARG instead of `-cflags` and
LIBS-ARG instead of `-libs`, if given.

The SED-EXPR-EXTRACTOR parameter representes the expression used in sed
to extract the version number. Use it if your 'foo-config -version'
dumps something like 'Foo library v1.0.0 (alfa)' instead of '1.0.0'.

The macro respects LIBRARY_CONFIG, LIBRARY_CFLAGS and LIBRARY_LIBS
variables. If the first one is defined, it specifies the name of the
config script to use. If the latter two are defined, the script is not
ran at all and their values are used instead (if only one of them is
defined, the empty value of the remaining one is still used).

Example:

       AX_PATH_GENERIC(Foo, 1.0.0)

would run `foo-config -version' and check that it is at least 1.0.0, if
successful the following variables would be defined and substituted:

       FOO_CFLAGS to `foo-config --cflags`
       FOO_LIBS   to `foo-config --libs`

Example:

       AX_PATH_GENERIC([Bar],,,[
          AC_MSG_ERROR([Cannot find Bar library])
       ])

would check for bar-config program, defining and substituting the
following variables:

       BAR_CFLAGS to `bar-config --cflags`
       BAR_LIBS   to `bar-config --libs`

Example:

       ./configure BAZ_LIBS=/usr/lib/libbaz.a

would link with a static version of baz library even if `baz-config
-libs` returns just "-lbaz" that would normally result in using the
shared library.

This macro is a rearranged version of AC_PATH_GENERIC from Angus Lees.

check for pcre lib and set PCRE_LIBS and PCRE_CFLAGS accordingly.

also provide -with-pcre option that may point to the $prefix of the
pcre installation - the macro will check $pcre/include and $pcre/lib to
contain the necessary files.

the usual two ACTION-IF-FOUND / ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND are supported and
they can take advantage of the LIBS/CFLAGS additions.

ax_path_milter
==============

Synopsis
********

     AX_PATH_MILTER([MINIMUM-VERSION, [ACTION-IF-FOUND [, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]]])

Description
***********

This macro tries to automatically find the library libmilter.a and the
header file "libmilter/mfapi.h", which are required when compiling a
milter for Sendmail. When successful, it sets the output variable
MILTER_LIBS to "-lmilter", MILTER_LDFLAGS to contain an -Lpathtolib
option, and MILTER_CPPFLAGS to contain an -Ipathtoinclude option, if
they are necessary.

The easiest way to use this macro is something like:

       AX_PATH_MILTER([8.12],[
         LIBS="$MILTER_LIBS $LIBS"
         LDFLAGS="$MILTER_LDFLAGS $LDFLAGS"
         CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $MILTER_CPPFLAGS"
       ],[
         AC_MSG_ERROR([required milter library and header not found])
       ])

If the macro is successful, it just adds any flags to the necessary
environment. If it is not successful, it would likely be a fatal error,
because if an application is linking with libmilter.a, it is probably
because it is a milter.

There are two optional "-with" options for configure which are added.
If they are specified, they override any searching that is done. They
are:

       --with-sendmail-base=<DIR>  This option is used to explicitly
              specify the base of the sendmail distribution.

       --with-sendmail-obj=<DIR>   The option is used to explicitly specify
              the "obj.*" subdirectory in the sendmail distribution
              that should be used.

When sendmail-base is not specified, the current environment is first
tested to see if the header and library are available, and if so
MILTER_LDFLAGS and MILTER_CPPFLAGS are left empty.

There are two places that are searched for the sendmail base directory.
The first location is one directory down from the current directory. It
checks if there is a directory of the form sendmail-8.1*, limited to
version 8.12.x or higher, then chooses the directory with the highest
version number. If that method does not succeed, it then looks in the
file /etc/mail/sendmail.cf for the directory it was built from, and uses
the base of that distribution. If neither of these methods work, then it
fails.

There are two methods for finding the "obj.*" directory when it is not
specified. The first is to try to run sendmail's Build program with the
-M option which will print out the name of the obj. directory for the
tool in the directory where it is run from. If this does not work, is
looks for the newest directory of the form "obj.*" in the sendmail base
directory.

Two addition output variables that are defined, whether or not the files
are found are SENDMAIL_BASE_DIR and SENDMAIL_OBJ_DIR, which are the
suspected location of the sendmail base directory and obj.*
subdirectory.

NOTE: POSIX threads MUST be configured BEFORE this function is called or
it will not find libmilter.a even if it exists. The easiest way is to
use the AX_PTHREAD macro by Steven G. Johnson and Alejandro Forero
Cuervo which is available from the Autoconf Macro Archive.

     AX_PATH_MISSING(VARIABLE, PROG-TO-CHECK-FOR, WARNING-IF-NOT-FOUND, PATH)

Description
***********

Check whether program PROG-TO-CHECK-FOR exists in path. If it is found,
set VARIABLE to the full path of PROG-TO-CHECK-FOR, otherwise warn using
the string WARNING-IF-NOT-FOUND and set VARIABLE to the full path of the
Automake missing script with PROG-TO-CHECK-FOR as the command to run.

A typical use is the following:

       AX_PATH_MISSING([AUTOGEN],[autogen],[autogen seems missing ...])

This macro is the combination of AC_PATH_PROG and AX_MISSING_PROG. If
you do not want to run AC_PATH_PROG, simply use AX_MISSING_PROG or
AM_MISSING.

==================

Synopsis

     AX_PGSQL_PRIV_ROOT(DB, USER, [HOST], [PASSWORD], [ACTION_IF_FAILED], [ACTION_IF_OK])

Description
***********

This macro checks wether the given PostgreSQL user has root privileges
(can create and drop databases) It is recommended to first call
AX_CHECK_PGSQL_DB, this makes it easier to locate the cause of error.
The macro AX_PROG_PGCLIENT is required by this one.

The variable $pgclient_root_call is set for later use in Makefiles, if
you'd like to make use of this, you must do

       AC_SUBST(pgclient_root_call)

after having called AX_CHECK_PGSQL_PRIV_ROOT. You can then do something
like the following in your Makefile.am:

       @pgclient_root_call@ -f file.sql

If you want the user to set the data, you should support something like
these configure options:

       AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-host,
               [  --with-pgsql-host=HOST               server is running on HOST @<:@local socket@:>@],
               [pg_host=$withval], [pg_host=])

       AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-db,
               [  --with-pgsql-db=DBNAME               use database DBNAME @<:@test@:>@],
               [pg_db=$withval], [pg_db=test])

       AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-root-user,
               [  --with-pgsql-root-user=USER          use user USER, must have root (all) privileges @<:@postgres@:>@],
               [pg_root_user=$withval], [pg_root_user=postgres])

       AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-password,
               [  --with-pgsql-password=PASSWORD       use password PASSWORD @<:@none@:>@],
               [pg_password=$withval], [pg_password=""])

You can then call the macro like this:

       AX_CHECK_PGSQL_PRIV_ROOT([$pg_db], [$pg_root_user], [$pg_host], [$pg_password], [AC_MSG_ERROR([We need root privileges on database!])])

ax_pkg_mico
===========

Synopsis
********

     AX_PKG_MICO([X.X.X optional required])

Description
***********

This macro searches for a MICO installation on your system. MICO (Mico
Is COrba) installs the file 'mico-setup.sh' under MICO_INSTALL_BASE/lib,
where MICO_INSTALL_BASE is probably /usr/local or /usr. If nothing was
specified when calling configure or just -with-mico, it searches in
$prefix/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib The argument of s-with-mico
specifies the full pathname of the mico-setup.sh file. For instance
-with-mico=/usr/local/mico-2.2.6/lib/mico-setup.sh.

If the version argument is given (e.g. 2.2.6), AX_PKG_MICO checks that
the mico package is this version number or higher.

The other optional argument to AX_PKG_MICO are 'optional' and
'required'. by default, placing AX_PKG_MICO in your configure.in does
not enforce using mico, if it is not found on the system. If MICO
existence is critical for the building of your package, then you
probably want to specify something like "AX_PKG_MICO(2.2.6 required)".
Then, even if the -with-mico was not spcefied on the command line of
the configure script, an error will be raised if mico was not found.

If the mico package is not found, abort configuration with error
message.

It defines the symbol MICOSETUP, MICOVERSION, MICOSHAREDDIR
MICO_INCLUDE, MICO_LIB and MICO_CXX if mico is found. In addition, the
mico script mico-c++ (set in (MICO_CXX) is scaned for a string match
"-I.*ministl" and if foundMICO_USE_MINISTL is set to 1, otherwise to 0.

Example of use of these variables in your Makefile.in:

       INCLUDES += @MICO_INCLUDE@
       LDFLAGS += @MICO_LIB@

Synopsis

     AX_PKG_SWIG([major.minor.micro], [action-if-found], [action-if-not-found])

Description
***********

This macro searches for a SWIG installation on your system. If found,
then SWIG is AC_SUBST'd; if not found, then $SWIG is empty.  If SWIG is
found, then SWIG_LIB is set to the SWIG library path, and AC_SUBST'd.

You can use the optional first argument to check if the version of the
available SWIG is greater than or equal to the value of the argument. It
should have the format: N[.N[.N]] (N is a number between 0 and 999. Only
the first N is mandatory.) If the version argument is given (e.g.
1.3.17), AX_PKG_SWIG checks that the swig package is this version number
or higher.

As usual, action-if-found is executed if SWIG is found, otherwise
action-if-not-found is executed.

In configure.in, use as:

       AX_PKG_SWIG(1.3.17, [], [ AC_MSG_ERROR([SWIG is required to build..]) ])
       AX_SWIG_ENABLE_CXX
       AX_SWIG_MULTI_MODULE_SUPPORT

ax_prefix_config_h
==================

Synopsis
********

     AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H [(OUTPUT-HEADER [,PREFIX [,ORIG-HEADER]])]

Description
***********

This is a new variant from ac_prefix_config_ this one will use a
lowercase-prefix if the config-define was starting with a
lowercase-char, e.g. "#define const", "#define restrict", or "#define
off_t", (and this one can live in another directory, e.g.
testpkg/config.h therefore I decided to move the output-header to be the
first arg)

takes the usual config.h generated header file; looks for each of the
generated "#define SOMEDEF" lines, and prefixes the defined name (ie.
makes it "#define PREFIX_SOMEDEF". The result is written to the output
config.header file. The PREFIX is converted to uppercase for the
conversions.

Defaults:

       OUTPUT-HEADER = $PACKAGE-config.h
       PREFIX = $PACKAGE
       ORIG-HEADER, from AM_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h)

Your configure.ac script should contain both macros in this order, and
unlike the earlier variations of this prefix-macro it is okay to place
the AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H call before the AC_OUTPUT invokation.

Example:

       AC_INIT(config.h.in)        # config.h.in as created by "autoheader"
       AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(testpkg, 0.1.1)    # makes #undef VERSION and PACKAGE
       AM_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h)          # prep config.h from config.h.in
       AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H(mylib/_config.h) # prep mylib/_config.h from it..
       AC_MEMORY_H                         # makes "#undef NEED_MEMORY_H"
       AC_C_CONST_H                        # makes "#undef const"
       AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)                 # creates the "config.h" now
                                           # and also mylib/_config.h

if the argument to AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H would have been omitted then the
default outputfile would have been called simply "testpkg-config.h", but
even under the name "mylib/_config.h" it contains prefix-defines like

       #ifndef TESTPKG_VERSION
       #define TESTPKG_VERSION "0.1.1"
       #endif
       #ifndef TESTPKG_NEED_MEMORY_H
       #define TESTPKG_NEED_MEMORY_H 1
       #endif
       #ifndef _testpkg_const
       #define _testpkg_const _const
       #endif

and this "mylib/_config.h" can be installed along with other
header-files, which is most convenient when creating a shared library
(that has some headers) where some functionality is dependent on the
OS-features detected at compile-time. No need to invent some
"mylib-confdefs.h.in" manually. :-)

Note that some AC_DEFINEs that end up in the config.h file are actually
self-referential - e.g. AC_C_INLINE, AC_C_CONST, and the AC_TYPE_OFF_T
say that they "will define inline|const|off_t if the system does not do
it by itself". You might want to clean up about these - consider an
extra mylib/conf.h that reads something like:

       #include <mylib/_config.h>
       #ifndef _testpkg_const
       #define _testpkg_const const
       #endif

and then start using _testpkg_const in the header files. That is also a
good thing to differentiate whether some library-user has starting to
take up with a different compiler, so perhaps it could read something
like this:

       #ifdef _MSC_VER
       #include <mylib/_msvc.h>
       #else
       #include <mylib/_config.h>
       #endif
       #ifndef _testpkg_const
       #define _testpkg_const const
       #endif

Synopsis

     AX_PRINTF_SIZE_T

Description
***********

Check for the appropriate printf() format string modifier to use with a
size_t argument. If a suitable modifier is found, it is AC_DEFINE'd as
PRI_SIZE_T_MODIFIER, and can be used in C code as e.g.

       printf("Size = %" PRI_SIZE_T_MODIFIER "u bytes.\n", sizeof(foo));

If you use the PRIxNN macros from ISO C99's <inttypes.h>, you may wish
to define a supplemental set of macros along similar lines:

       #define PRIdSIZE PRI_SIZE_T_MODIFIER "d"
       #define PRIiSIZE PRI_SIZE_T_MODIFIER "i"
       #define PRIoSIZE PRI_SIZE_T_MODIFIER "o"
       #define PRIuSIZE PRI_SIZE_T_MODIFIER "u"
       #define PRIxSIZE PRI_SIZE_T_MODIFIER "x"
       #define PRIXSIZE PRI_SIZE_T_MODIFIER "X"

Note: This macro invokes a test program to check whether a given format
modifier is understood by the system's sprintf() function. If the user
is cross-compiling, then this check cannot be performed, and thereby
PRI_SIZE_T_MODIFIER will remain undefined.

Synopsis

     AX_PROG_APACHE([version])

Description
***********

This macro searches for an installed apache server. If nothing was
specified when calling configure or just -with-apache, it searches in
/usr/local/apache/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
The argument of -with-apache specifies the full pathname of the httpd
argument. For instance -with-apache=/usr/sbin/httpd.

If the version argument is given, AX_PROG_APACHE checks that the apache
server is this version number or higher.

If the apache server is not found, abort configuration with error
message.

It defines the symbol APACHE if the server is found.

Files using apache should do the following:

       @APACHE@ -d /etc/httpd

It defines the symbol APACHE_MODULES if a directory containing mod_env.*
is found in the default server root directory (obtained with httpd -V).

The httpd.conf file listing modules to be loaded dynamicaly can use
@APACHE_MODULES@ to grab them in the appropriate sub directory. For
instance:

      ...
      <IfModule mod_so.c>
      LoadModule env_module         @APACHE_MODULES@/mod_env.so
      LoadModule config_log_module  @APACHE_MODULES@/mod_log_config.so

====================

Synopsis

     AX_PROG_CC_FOR_BUILD

Description
***********

This macro searches for a C compiler that generates native executables,
that is a C compiler that surely is not a cross-compiler. This can be
useful if you have to generate source code at compile-time like for
example GCC does.

The macro sets the CC_FOR_BUILD and CPP_FOR_BUILD macros to anything
needed to compile or link (CC_FOR_BUILD) and preprocess (CPP_FOR_BUILD).
The value of these variables can be overridden by the user by specifying
a compiler with an environment variable (like you do for standard CC).

It also sets BUILD_EXEEXT and BUILD_OBJEXT to the executable and object
file extensions for the build platform, and GCC_FOR_BUILD to `yes' if
the compiler we found is GCC. All these variables but GCC_FOR_BUILD are
substituted in the Makefile.

Synopsis

     AX_PROG_CC_MPI([MPI-WANTED-TEST[, ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]]])

Description
***********

This macro tries to find out how to compile C programs that use MPI
(Message Passing Interface), a standard API for parallel process
communication (see http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/). The macro has to
be used instead of the standard macro AC_PROG_CC and will replace the
standard variable CC with the found compiler.

MPI-WANTED-TEST is used to test whether MPI is actually wanted by the
user. If MPI-WANTED_TEST is omitted or if it succeeds, the macro will
try to find out how to use MPI, if it fails, the macro will call
AC_PROG_CC to find a standard C compiler instead.

When MPI is found, ACTION-IF-FOUND will be executed, if MPI is not found
(or MPI-WANTED-TEST fails) ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is executed. If
ACTION-IF-FOUND is not set, the macro will define HAVE_MPI.

The following example demonstrates usage of the macro:

       # If --with-mpi=auto is used, try to find MPI, but use standard C compiler if it is not found.
       # If --with-mpi=yes is used, try to find MPI and fail if it isn't found.
       # If --with-mpi=no is used, use a standard C compiler instead.
       AC_ARG_WITH(mpi, [AS_HELP_STRING([--with-mpi],
           [compile with MPI (parallelization) support. If none is found,
           MPI is not used. Default: auto])
       ],,[with_mpi=auto])
       #
       AX_PROG_CC_MPI([test x"$with_mpi" != xno],[use_mpi=yes],[
         use_mpi=no
         if test x"$with_mpi" = xyes; then
           AC_MSG_FAILURE([MPI compiler requested, but couldn't use MPI.])
         else
           AC_MSG_WARN([No MPI compiler found, won't use MPI.])

============

Synopsis
********

     AX_PROG_CP_S

Description
***********

Check how to make a copy by creating a symbolic link to the original -
it defines the variable CP_S for further use, which you should in fact
treat like it used to be with be LN_S. The actual value is assured to be
either LN_S (if the filesystem supports symbolic links) or CP (if the
filesystem does not know about symbolic links and you need a copy of
original file to have the same text in both places). In a gnu
environment it will simply set CP_S="cp -s" since the gnu "cp"-command
has the "-s" flag. You shall not try to use this command on directories
since it would require a "-r" in the case of a copy that is not
supported explicitly here. (I'm not sure if some "cp"-commands out there
would barf at usage of "-r" on a normal file).

Use CP_S to create a copy of read-only data - if your filesystem
supports it then a symbolic link is created - a process that is quicker
and space-saving. However, if the target fs does not support symbolic
links, just copy the data. Unlike ac_prog_ln_s this macro will never
fail to set the CP_S ac_subst to something that works.

Synopsis

     DX_INIT_DOXYGEN(PROJECT-NAME, DOXYFILE-PATH, [OUTPUT-DIR])
     DX_DOXYGEN_FEATURE(ON|OFF)
     DX_DOT_FEATURE(ON|OFF)
     DX_HTML_FEATURE(ON|OFF)

     DX_XML_FEATURE(ON|OFF)
     DX_PDF_FEATURE(ON|OFF)
     DX_PS_FEATURE(ON|OFF)

Description
***********

The DX_*_FEATURE macros control the default setting for the given
Doxygen feature. Supported features are 'DOXYGEN' itself, 'DOT' for
generating graphics, 'HTML' for plain HTML, 'CHM' for compressed HTML
help (for MS users), 'CHI' for generating a seperate .chi file by the
.chm file, and 'MAN', 'RTF', 'XML', 'PDF' and 'PS' for the appropriate
output formats. The environment variable DOXYGEN_PAPER_SIZE may be
specified to override the default 'a4wide' paper size.

By default, HTML, PDF and PS documentation is generated as this seems to
be the most popular and portable combination. MAN pages created by
Doxygen are usually problematic, though by picking an appropriate subset
and doing some massaging they might be better than nothing. CHM and RTF
are specific for MS (note that you can't generate both HTML and CHM at
the same time). The XML is rather useless unless you apply specialized
post-processing to it.

The macros mainly control the default state of the feature. The use can
override the default by specifying -enable or -disable. The macros
ensure that contradictory flags are not given (e.g.,
-enable-doxygen-html and -enable-doxygen-chm, -enable-doxygen-anything
with -disable-doxygen, etc.) Finally, each feature will be
automatically disabled (with a warning) if the required programs are
missing.

Once all the feature defaults have been specified, call DX_INIT_DOXYGEN
with the following parameters: a one-word name for the project for use
as a filename base etc., an optional configuration file name (the
default is 'Doxyfile', the same as Doxygen's default), and an optional
output directory name (the default is 'doxygen-doc').

Automake Support

The following is a template aminclude.am file for use with Automake.
Make targets and variables values are controlled by the various
DX_COND_* conditionals set by autoconf.

The provided targets are:

       doxygen-doc: Generate all doxygen documentation.

       doxygen-run: Run doxygen, which will generate some of the
                    documentation (HTML, CHM, CHI, MAN, RTF, XML)
                    but will not do the post processing required
                    for the rest of it (PS, PDF, and some MAN).

       doxygen-man: Rename some doxygen generated man pages.

       doxygen-ps:  Generate doxygen PostScript documentation.

       doxygen-pdf: Generate doxygen PDF documentation.

Note that by default these are not integrated into the automake targets.
If doxygen is used to generate man pages, you can achieve this
integration by setting man3_MANS to the list of man pages generated and
then adding the dependency:

       $(man3_MANS): doxygen-doc

This will cause make to run doxygen and generate all the documentation.

The following variable is intended for use in Makefile.am:

       DX_CLEANFILES = everything to clean.

Then add this variable to MOSTLYCLEANFILES.

Synopsis

     AX_PROG_F77_MPI([MPI-WANTED-TEST[, ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]]])

Description
***********

This macro tries to find out how to compile Fortran77 programs that use
MPI (Message Passing Interface), a standard API for parallel process
communication (see http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/).  The macro has to
be used instead of the standard macro AC_PROG_F77 and will replace the
standard variable F77 with the found compiler.

MPI-WANTED-TEST is used to test whether MPI is actually wanted by the
user. If MPI-WANTED_TEST is omitted or if it succeeds, the macro will
try to find out how to use MPI, if it fails, the macro will call
AC_PROG_CC to find a standard C compiler instead.

When MPI is found, ACTION-IF-FOUND will be executed, if MPI is not found
(or MPI-WANTED-TEST fails) ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is executed. If
ACTION-IF-FOUND is not set, the macro will define HAVE_MPI.

The following example demonstrates usage of the macro:

       # If --with-mpi=auto is used, try to find MPI, but use standard F77 compiler if it is not found.
       # If --with-mpi=yes is used, try to find MPI and fail if it isn't found.
       # If --with-mpi=no is used, use a standard F77 compiler instead.
       AC_ARG_WITH(mpi, [AS_HELP_STRING([--with-mpi],
           [compile with MPI (parallelization) support. If none is found,
           MPI is not used. Default: auto])
       ],,[with_mpi=auto])

       AX_PROG_F77_MPI([test x"$with_mpi" != xno],[use_mpi=yes],[
         use_mpi=no
         if test x"$with_mpi" = xyes; then
           AC_MSG_FAILURE([MPI compiler requested, but couldn't use MPI.])
         else
           AC_MSG_WARN([No MPI compiler found, won't use MPI.])
         fi
       ])

     AX_PROG_FASM([ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])

Description
***********

This macro searches for the FASM assembler and sets the variable "fasm"
to the name of the application or to "no" if not found. If
ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is not specified, configure will fail when the
program is not found.

Synopsis

     AX_PROG_GUILE_VERSION([VERSION],[ACTION-IF-TRUE],[ACTION-IF-FALSE])

Description
***********

Makes sure that guile supports the version indicated. If true the shell
commands in ACTION-IF-TRUE are executed. If not the shell commands in
ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. Note if $GUILE is not set (for example by
running AC_CHECK_PROG or AC_PATH_PROG) the macro will fail.

Example:

       AC_PATH_PROG([GUILE],[guile])
       AC_PROG_GUILE_VERSION([1.6.0],[ ... ],[ ... ])

This will check to make sure that the guile you have supports at least
version 1.6.0.

NOTE: This macro uses the $GUILE variable to perform the check.
AX_WITH_GUILE can be used to set that variable prior to running this
macro. The $GUILE_VERSION variable will be valorized with the detected
version.

     AX_PROG_JAR

Description
***********

AX_PROG_JAR tests for an existing jar program. It uses the environment
variable JAR then tests in sequence various common jar programs.

If you want to force a specific compiler:

- at the configure.in level, set JAR=yourcompiler before calling
AX_PROG_JAR

- at the configure level, setenv JAR

You can use the JAR variable in your Makefile.in, with @JAR@.

Note: This macro depends on the autoconf M4 macros for Java programs. It
is VERY IMPORTANT that you download that whole set, some macros depend
on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission.

The general documentation of those macros, as well as the sample
configure.in, is included in the AX_PROG_JAVA macro.

     AX_PROG_JAVA

Description
***********

Here is a summary of the main macros:

AX_PROG_JAVAC: finds a Java compiler.

AX_PROG_JAVA: finds a Java virtual machine.

AX_CHECK_CLASS: finds if we have the given class (beware of CLASSPATH!).

AX_CHECK_RQRD_CLASS: finds if we have the given class and stops
otherwise.

AX_TRY_COMPILE_JAVA: attempt to compile user given source.

AX_TRY_RUN_JAVA: attempt to compile and run user given source.

AX_JAVA_OPTIONS: adds Java configure options.

AX_PROG_JAVA tests an existing Java virtual machine. It uses the
environment variable JAVA then tests in sequence various common Java
virtual machines. For political reasons, it starts with the free ones.
You *must* call [AX_PROG_JAVAC] before.

If you want to force a specific VM:

- at the configure.in level, set JAVA=yourvm before calling AX_PROG_JAVA

       (but after AC_INIT)

- at the configure level, setenv JAVA

You can use the JAVA variable in your Makefile.in, with @JAVA@.

*Warning*: its success or failure can depend on a proper setting of the
CLASSPATH env. variable.

TODO: allow to exclude virtual machines (rationale: most Java programs
cannot run with some VM like kaffe).

Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set, some macros depend
on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission.

A Web page, with a link to the latest CVS snapshot is at

Synopsis
********

     AX_PROG_JAVA_CC

Description
***********

Finds the appropriate java compiler on your path. By preference the java
compiler is gcj, then jikes then javac.

The macro can take one argument specifying a space separated list of
java compiler names.

For example:

       AX_PROG_JAVA_CC(javac, gcj)

The macro also sets the compiler options variable: JAVA_CC_OPTS to
something sensible:

      - for GCJ it sets it to: @GCJ_OPTS@
        (if GCJ_OPTS is not yet defined then it is set to "-C")

      - no other compiler has applicable options yet

Here's an example configure.in:

       AC_INIT(Makefile.in)
       AX_PROG_JAVA_CC()
       AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)
       dnl End.

And here's the start of the Makefile.in:

       PROJECT_ROOT      := @srcdir@
       # Tool definitions.
       JAVAC             := @JAVA_CC@
       JAVAC_OPTS        := @JAVA_CC_OPTS@
       JAR_TOOL          := @jar_tool@

Synopsis
********

     AX_PROG_JAVADOC

Description
***********

AX_PROG_JAVADOC tests for an existing javadoc generator. It uses the
environment variable JAVADOC then tests in sequence various common
javadoc generator.

If you want to force a specific compiler:

- at the configure.in level, set JAVADOC=yourgenerator before calling
AX_PROG_JAVADOC

- at the configure level, setenv JAVADOC

You can use the JAVADOC variable in your Makefile.in, with @JAVADOC@.

Note: This macro depends on the autoconf M4 macros for Java programs. It
is VERY IMPORTANT that you download that whole set, some macros depend
on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission.

The general documentation of those macros, as well as the sample
configure.in, is included in the AX_PROG_JAVA macro.

ax_prog_perl_version
====================

Synopsis
********

     AX_PROG_PERL_VERSION([VERSION],[ACTION-IF-TRUE],[ACTION-IF-FALSE])

Description
***********

Makes sure that perl supports the version indicated. If true the shell
commands in ACTION-IF-TRUE are executed. If not the shell commands in
ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. Note if $PERL is not set (for example by
running AC_CHECK_PROG or AC_PATH_PROG) the macro will fail.

Example:

       AC_PATH_PROG([PERL],[perl])
       AX_PROG_PERL_VERSION([5.8.0],[ ... ],[ ... ])

This will check to make sure that the perl you have supports at least
version 5.8.0.

NOTE: This macro uses the $PERL variable to perform the check.
AX_WITH_PERL can be used to set that variable prior to running this
macro. The $PERL_VERSION variable will be valorized with the detected
version.

     AX_PROG_PGCLIENT()

Description
***********

This macro searches for a program called 'pgclient'. If found the
variable $pgclient is set to its path. Else it is set to 0. An option is
added to the configure script for setting an search path instead of
$PATH ($pgclient_dir). If pgclient is necessary for installing your
program, you can do something like the following to stop configure with
an error if pgclient wasn't found:

       if test "x$pgclient" = "x0"; then AC_MSG_ERROR([We need that to setup the database!]); fi

pgclient can be found at http://pgclient.freesources.org

     AX_PROTOTYPE(function, includes, code, TAG1, values1 [, TAG2, values2 [...]])

Description
***********

Try all the combinations of <TAG1>, <TAG2>... to successfully compile
<code>. <TAG1>, <TAG2>, ... are substituted in <code> and <include> with
values found in <values1>, <values2>, ... respectively. <values1>,
<values2>, ... contain a list of possible values for each corresponding
tag and all combinations are tested. When AC_TRY_COMPILE(include, code)
is successfull for a given substitution, the macro stops and defines the
following macros: FUNCTION_TAG1, FUNCTION_TAG2, ... using AC_DEFINE()
with values set to the current values of <TAG1>, <TAG2>, ... If no
combination is successfull the configure script is aborted with a
message.

Intended purpose is to find which combination of argument types is
acceptable for a given function <function>. It is recommended to list
the most specific types first. For instance ARG1, [size_t, int] instead
of ARG1, [int, size_t].

Generic usage pattern:

1) add a call in configure.in

      AX_PROTOTYPE(...)

2) call autoheader to see which symbols are not covered

3) add the lines in acconfig.h

      /* Type of Nth argument of function */
      #undef FUNCTION_ARGN

4) Within the code use FUNCTION_ARGN instead of an hardwired type

Complete example:

1) configure.in

      AX_PROTOTYPE(getpeername,
      [
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/socket.h>
      ],
      [
       int a = 0;
       ARG2 * b = 0;
       ARG3 * c = 0;
       getpeername(a, b, c);
      ],
      ARG2, [struct sockaddr, void],
      ARG3, [socklen_t, size_t, int, unsigned int, long unsigned int])

2) call autoheader

      autoheader: Symbol `GETPEERNAME_ARG2' is not covered by ./acconfig.h
      autoheader: Symbol `GETPEERNAME_ARG3' is not covered by ./acconfig.h

3) acconfig.h

      /* Type of second argument of getpeername */
      #undef GETPEERNAME_ARG2

      /* Type of third argument of getpeername */
      #undef GETPEERNAME_ARG3

4) in the code

       ...
       GETPEERNAME_ARG2 name;
       GETPEERNAME_ARG3 namelen;
       ...
       ret = getpeername(socket, &name, &namelen);
       ...

Implementation notes: generating all possible permutations of the
arguments is not easily done with the usual mixture of shell and m4,
that is why this macro is almost 100% m4 code. It generates long but
simple to read code.

     AX_PTHREAD([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Description
***********

This macro figures out how to build C programs using POSIX threads. It
sets the PTHREAD_LIBS output variable to the threads library and linker
flags, and the PTHREAD_CFLAGS output variable to any special C compiler
flags that are needed. (The user can also force certain compiler
flags/libs to be tested by setting these environment variables.)

Also sets PTHREAD_CC to any special C compiler that is needed for
multi-threaded programs (defaults to the value of CC otherwise). (This
is necessary on AIX to use the special cc_r compiler alias.)

NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these flags,
but also link it with them as well. e.g. you should link with
$PTHREAD_CC $CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS $LDFLAGS ... $PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS

If you are only building threads programs, you may wish to use these
variables in your default LIBS, CFLAGS, and CC:

       LIBS="$PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS"
       CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS"
       CC="$PTHREAD_CC"

In addition, if the PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE thread-attribute constant
has a nonstandard name, defines PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE to that name
(e.g. PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED on AIX).

Also HAVE_PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT is defined if pthread is found and the
PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT symbol is defined when compiling with
PTHREAD_CFLAGS.

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a threads library
is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it
is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action
will define HAVE_PTHREAD.

Please let the authors know if this macro fails on any platform, or if
you have any other suggestions or comments. This macro was based on work
by SGJ on autoconf scripts for FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/) (with help
from M. Frigo), as well as ac_pthread and hb_pthread macros posted by
Alejandro Forero Cuervo to the autoconf macro repository. We are also
grateful for the helpful feedback of numerous users.

     AX_PYTHON

Description
***********

This macro does a complete Python development environment check.

It recurses through several python versions (from 2.1 to 2.6 in this
version), looking for an executable. When it finds an executable, it
looks to find the header files and library.

It sets PYTHON_BIN to the name of the python executable,
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR to the directory holding the header files, and
PYTHON_LIB to the name of the Python library.

This macro calls AC_SUBST on PYTHON_BIN (via AC_CHECK_PROG),
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR and PYTHON_LIB.

     AX_PYTHON_MAKEFILE

Description
***********

AX_PYTHON_CONFIG_VAR:

Using the Python module distutils.sysconfig[1], return a Python
configuration variable. PYTHON_VARIABLE is the name of the variable to
request from Python, and SHELL_VARIABLE is the name of the shell
variable into which the results should be deposited. If SHELL_VARIABLE
is not specified, the macro wil prefix PY_ to the PYTHON_VARIABLE, e.g.,
LIBS -> PY_LIBS.

SHELL_VARIABLE is AC_SUBST'd. No action is taken if an error occurs.
Note if $PYTHON is not set, AC_CHECK_PROG(PYTHON, python, python) will
be run.

Example:

       AX_PYTHON_CONFIG_VAR(LINKFORSHARED, PY_LFS)

AX_PYTHON_CONFIG_H:

Using the Python module distutils.sysconfig[1], put the full pathname of
the config.h file used to compile Python into the shell variable
PY_CONFIG_H. PY_CONFIG_H is AC_SUBST'd. Note if $PYTHON is not set,
AC_CHECK_PROG(PYTHON, python, python) will be run.

AX_PYTHON_MAKEFILE:

Using the Python module distutils.sysconfig[1], put the full pathname of
the Makefile file used to compile Python into the shell variable
PY_MAKEFILE. PY_MAKEFILE is AC_SUBST'd. Note if $PYTHON is not set,
AC_CHECK_PROG(PYTHON, python, python) will be run.

     AX_PYTHON_DEVEL([version])

Description
***********

Note: Defines as a precious variable "PYTHON_VERSION". Don't override it
in your configure.ac.

This macro checks for Python and tries to get the include path to
'Python.h'. It provides the $(PYTHON_CPPFLAGS) and $(PYTHON_LDFLAGS)
output variables. It also exports $(PYTHON_EXTRA_LIBS) and
$(PYTHON_EXTRA_LDFLAGS) for embedding Python in your code.

You can search for some particular version of Python by passing a
parameter to this macro, for example ">= '2.3.1'", or "== '2.4'". Please
note that you *have* to pass also an operator along with the version to
match, and pay special attention to the single quotes surrounding the
version number. Don't use "PYTHON_VERSION" for this: that environment
variable is declared as precious and thus reserved for the end-user.

This macro should work for all versions of Python >= 2.1.0. As an end
user, you can disable the check for the python version by setting the
PYTHON_NOVERSIONCHECK environment variable to something else than the
empty string.

If you need to use this macro for an older Python version, please
contact the authors. We're always open for feedback.

     AX_PYTHON_ENABLE
     AX_PYTHON_WITH

     AX_PYTHON_VERSION_ENSURE( [2.2] )
     AX_PYTHON_CSPEC
     AX_PYTHON_LSPEC

Description
***********

This file provides autoconf support for those applications that want to
embed python. It supports all pythons >= 2.2 which is the first official
release containing distutils. Version 2.2 of python was released
December 21, 2001. Since it actually executes the python, cross platform
configuration will probably not work. Also, most of the platforms
supported are consistent until you look into Mac OS X. The python
included with it is installed as a framework which is a very different
environment to set up the normal tools such as gcc and libtool to deal
with. Therefore, once we establish which python that we are going to
use, we use its distutils to actually compile and link our modules or
applications.

At this time, it does NOT support linking with Python statically. It
does support dynamic linking.

This set of macros help define $PYTHON, $PYTHON_USE, $PYTHON_CSPEC and
$PYTHON_LSPEC. $PYTHON defines the full executable path for the Python
being linked to and is used within these macros to determine if that has
been specified or found. These macros do execute this python version so
it must be present on the system at configure time.

$PYTHON_USE is an automake variable that defines whether Python support
should be included or not in your application. $PYTHON_CSPEC is a
variable that supplies additional CFLAGS for the compilation of the
application/shared library. $PYTHON_LSPEC is a variable that supplies
additional LDFLAGS for linking the application/shared library.

The following is an example of how to set up for python usage within
your application in your configure.in:

       AX_PYTHON_DEFAULT( )
       AX_PYTHON_ENABLE( )             # Optional
       AX_PYTHON_WITH( )               # Optional
       AX_PYTHON_PATH( )               # or AX_PYTHON_INSIST( )
       # if $PYTHON is not defined, then the following do nothing.
       AX_PYTHON_VERSION_ENSURE( [2.2] )
       AX_PYTHON_CSPEC
       AX_PYTHON_LSPEC

The AX_PYTHON_DEFAULT sets the $PYTHON_USE to false. Thereby, excluding
it if it was optional.

The AX_PYTHON_ENABLE looks for the optional configure parameters of
-enable-python/-disable-python and establishes the $PYTHON and
$PYTHON_USE variables accordingly.

The AX_PYTHON_WITH looks for the optional configure parameters of
-with-python/-without-python and establishes the $PYTHON and
$PYTHON_USE variables accordingly.

The AX_PYTHON_PATH looks for python assuming that none has been
previously found or defined and issues an error if it does not find it.
If it does find it, it establishes the $PYTHON and $PYTHON_USE variables
accordingly. AX_PYTHON_INSIST could be used here instead if you want to
insist that Python support be included using the -enable-python or
-with-python checks previously done.

The AX_PYTHON_VERSION_ENSURE issues an error if the Python previously
found is not of version 2.2 or greater.

Once that these macros have be run, we can use PYTHON_USE within the
makefile.am file to conditionally add the Python support such as:

Makefile.am example showing optional inclusion of directories:

      if PYTHON_USE
      plugins = plugins
      src = src
      else
      plugins =
      src =
      endif

      SUBDIRS = . $(plugins) $(src)

Makefile.am example showing optional shared library build:

      if PYTHON_USE
      lib_LTLIBRARIES        = libElemList.la
      libElemList_la_SOURCES = libElemList.c
      libElemList_la_CFLAGS  = @PYTHON_CSPEC@
      libElemList_la_LDFLAGS = @PYTHON_LSPEC@
      endif

Makefile.am example showing optional program build:

      if PYTHON_USE
      bin_PROGRAMS    = runFunc
      runFunc_SOURCES = runFunc.c
      runFunc_CFLAGS  = @PYTHON_CSPEC@
      runFunc_LDFLAGS = @PYTHON_LSPEC@
      endif

The above compiles the modules only if PYTHON_USE was specified as true.
Also, the else portion of the if was optional.

     AX_REQUIRE_ONE_FUNC (FUNCTION..., [ACTION-IF-ANY-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NONE-FOUND])

Description
***********

AX_REQUIRE_ONE_FUNC is a simple wrapper for AC_CHECK_FUNCS. It calls
AC_CHECK_FUNCS on the list of functions named in the first argument,
then invokes ACTION-IF-ANY-FOUND if at least one of the functions exists
or ACTION-IF-NONE-FOUND if none of the functions exist.

Here's an example:

       AX_REQUIRE_ONE_FUNC([posix_memalign memalign valloc], ,
         [AC_MSG_ERROR([unable to allocate page-aligned memory])])

ax_rpm_init
===========

Synopsis
********

     AX_RPM_INIT

Description
***********

Setup variables for creation of rpms. It will define several variables
useful for creating rpms on a system where rpms are supported.
Currently, I requires changes to Makefile.am to function properly (see
the example below).

Also note that I do not use any non-UNIX OSs (and for the most part, I
only use RedHat), so this is probably generally not useful for other
systems.

Required setup:

In configure.in:

       dnl For my rpm.m4 macros
       RPM_RELEASE=1
       AC_SUBST(RPM_RELEASE)

       AX_RPM_INIT
       dnl Enable or disable the rpm making rules in Makefile.am
       AM_CONDITIONAL(MAKE_RPMS, test x$make_rpms = xtrue)

Furthermore, the %GNUconfigure rpm macro has a problem in that it does
not define CXXFLAGS for the target system correctly, so for compiling
C++ code, add the following line _before_ calling AC_PROG_CXX:

       dnl This is a little hack to make this work with rpm better (see mysql++.spec.in)
       test -z "$CXXFLAGS" && CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

Changes to Makefile.am (I am trying to get rid of this step; suggestions
invited):

       if MAKE_RPMS
       rpm: @RPM_TARGET@

       .PHONY: rpm

       $(RPM_TARGET): $(DISTFILES)
         ${MAKE} dist
         -mkdir -p $(RPM_DIR)/SRPMS
         -mkdir -p `dirname $(RPM_TARGET)`
         $(RPM_PROG) $(RPM_ARGS) $(RPM_TARBALL)
         @echo Congratulations, $(RPM_TARGET) "(and friends)" should now exist.
       else
       endif

Also, it works best with a XXXX.spec.in file like the following (this is
way down on the wishlist, but a program to generate the skeleton spec.in
much like autoscan would just kick butt!):

     AX_RUBY_DEVEL([version])

Description
***********

This macro checks for Ruby and tries to get the include path to
'ruby.h'. It provides the $(RUBY_CPPFLAGS) and $(RUBY_LDFLAGS) output
variables. It also exports $(RUBY_EXTRA_LIBS) for embedding Ruby in your
code.

You can search for some particular version of Ruby by passing a
parameter to this macro, for example "1.8.6".

     AX_RUBY_EXT

Description
***********

Fetches the linker flags and C compiler flags for compiling and linking
Ruby binary extensions.  The macro substitutes RUBY_VERSION,
RUBY_EXT_INC, RUBY_EXT_LIB, RUBY_EXT_CPPFLAGS, RUBY_EXT_LDFLAGS and
RUBY_EXT_DLEXT variables if Ruby executable has been found.  It also
checks the same variables before trying to retrieve them from the Ruby
configuration.

       RUBY_VERSION: version of the Ruby interpreter
       RUBY_EXT_INC: Ruby include directory
       RUBY_EXT_LIB: Ruby extensions destination directory
       RUBY_EXT_CPPFLAGS: C preprocessor flags to compile extensions
       RUBY_EXT_LDFLAGS: linker flags to build extensions
       RUBY_EXT_DLEXT: extensions suffix for ruby modules (e.g. "so")

Examples:

       AX_RUBY_EXT
       if test x"$RUBY" = x; then
          AC_ERROR(["cannot find Ruby"])
       fi

Searches for the sip executable and the sip include path. The sip
include path consists of two components, one which contains the file
qt/qtmod.sip and the other one the path to sip.h, which should be found
in the include/pythonX.Y directory.

The macro bails out if the executable or the file cannot be located.
Otherwise it defines:

       SIP           the path to the sip executable
       SIP_CPPFLAGS  include path: -I<path-to-qt/qtmod.sip> -I<path-to-sip.h-dir>

Example:

       AX_SIP_DEVEL
       AX_SIP_DEVEL([4.1])

Requires: perl (for version string comparison)

FIXME: Use AX_COMPARE_VERSION instead.

     AX_SPEC_PACKAGE_AND_VERSION ([specfile])
     AX_SPEC_PACKAGE_NAME ([shellvar],[defaultvalue])
     AX_SPEC_PACKAGE_VERSION ([shellvar],[defaultvalue])
     AX_SPEC_PACKAGE_SUMMARY ([shellvar],[defaultvalue])

     AX_SPEC_PACKAGE_CATEGORY ([shellvar],[defaultvalue])
     AX_SPEC_PACKAGE_ICON ([shellvar],[defaultvalue])
     AX_SPEC_DEFAULTS([specfile])

Description
***********

set PACKAGE from the given specfile - default to basename of the
rpmspecfile if no "name:" could be found in the spec file.

set VERSION from the given specfile - default to a date-derived value if
no "version:" could be found in the spec file.

this macro builds on top of AX_SPEC_FILE / AX_SPEC_EXTRACT

more specific: if not "name:" or "%define name" was found in the
myproject.spec file then the PACKAGE var is set to the basename
"myproject". When no spec file was present then it will usually default
to "TODO".

The version spec looks for "version:" or "%define version" in the spec
file. When no such value was seen or no spec file had been present then
the value is set to `date +0.%y.%W%w`.

the version value itself is sanitized somewhat with making it to always
carry atleast three digits (1.2.3) and clensing superflous "0" chars
around from generating numbers elsewhere.

additional macros are provided that extract a specific value from the
spec file, among these:

set PACKAGE_SUMMARY from the given specfile - default to package and try
to detect a type suffix if "summary:" was not in the spec file

set PACKAGE_LICENSE from the given specfile - if no "license:" tag was
given in the spec file then various COPYING files are grepped to have a
guess and the final fallback will be GNU GPL (or GNU LGPL).

set PACKAGE_ICON from the given specfile - if no "icon:" tag was given
in the spec file then we default to $PACKAGE-icon.png

the final AX_SPEC_INIT(specfile) will initialize all variables to its
defaults according to the spec file given.

     AX_STRING_STRCASECMP

Description
***********

This macro tries to find strcasecmp() in string.h.

Use this macro in conjunction with AX_STRINGS_STRCASECMP in your
configure.in like so:

       AX_STRING_STRCASECMP
       if test x"$ac_cv_string_strcasecmp" = "xno" ; then
           AX_STRINGS_STRCASECMP
       fi

This will cause either HAVE_STRING_STRCASECMP or HAVE_STRINGS_STRCASECMP
to be defined in config.h, which will tell your code what header to
include to get strcasecmp()'s prototype.

This macro checks to see if sys/sem.h defines struct semun. Some systems
do, some systems don't. Your code must be able to deal with this
possibility; if HAVE_STRUCT_SEMUM isn't defined for a given system, you
have to define this structure before you can call functions like
semctl().

You should call AX_SYSV_IPC before this macro, to separate the check for
System V IPC headers from the check for struct semun.

Synopsis

     AX_SUBST_WITH([varname])

Description
***********

a very simple macro but also very helpful - the varname is usually the
one from an AC_ARG_ENABLE or AC_ARG_WITH option. it is transliterated
into uppercase and a prefix WITH_ and WITHOUT_ that are both _SUBSTed.

Only one of these is set to "#" while the other is empty. In other words
a call like AC_WITHNONE(enable-call) will create two SUBST-symbols as
WITH_ENABLE_CALL and WITHOUT_ENABLE_CALL. When the varname had been set
to something not "no" or "0" or ":" or "false" then it results in

      WITH_ENABLE_CALL="" ; WITHOUT_ENABLE_CALL="#"

which you can use in your Makefile quite easily as if using an
AM_CONDITIONAL but which can be also parsed by normal make

USE = @WITH_ENABLE_CALL@ -Denabled USE = @WITHOUT_ENABLE_CALL@
-Dnot_enabled

==========================

Synopsis
********

     AX_SYS_LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE

Description
***********

Check whether the current system is sensitive to -Ddefines making off_t
having different types/sizes. Automatically define a config.h symbol
LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE if that is the case, otherwise leave everything as
is.

This macro builds on top of AC_SYS_LARGEFILE to detect whether special
options are neede to make the code use 64bit off_t - in many setups this
will also make the code use 64bit off_t immediatly.

The common use of a LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE config.h-define is to rename
exported functions, usually adding a 64 to the original function name.
Such renamings are only needed on systems being both (a) 32bit off_t by
default and (b) implementing large.file extensions (as for unix98).

a renaming section could look like this:

      #if defined LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE && _FILE_OFFSET_BITS+0 == 64
      #define zzip_open zzip_open64
      #define zzip_seek zzip_seek64
      #endif

for libraries, it is best to take advantage of the prefix-config.h
macro, otherwise you want to export a renamed LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE in an
installed header file. -> see AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H

====================

Synopsis
********

     AX_SYS_PERLSHARPBANG

Description
***********

Determine how the perl interpreter is located by the OS kernel and make
substitution variable PERL_SHEBANG available. Does AC_PATH_PROG to find
the path to perl. As a side-effect, that sets PERLINTERP and makes it
available as a substitution variable.

Note: The macro allows for the possibility (expected to be seldom used)
of an explicit user override (the "user" being the operator executing
the final 'configure' script, in this context) by making the option
argument like:

       --with-perl-shebang='#! /my/funky/perlpath' # OR
       --with-perl-shebang='/my/funky/perlpath'  # we just throw away the #! anyway
                                                 # bec it must be absent in Makefile

Rationale: The are various ways of starting an interpreter on different
*nix-like systems. Many use the simple

       #!/usr/bin/perl

but it could be instead

       #!/usr/local/bin/perl

and there is even the possibility that the user wants

       #!/usr/bin/env perl

to find whichever perl comes first in the current $PATH. This is
preferred by some of us because we run multiple perl installations on
the same box. Adjusting our $PATH then allows us to set precedence over
other perls, even whatever the "house" version is.

Users on very non-unix systems like MS Windows do not have a kernel that
does this kind of thing from the first line of script files, but instead
the perl on their machine is started and merely notices whatever comes
after the interpreter path on this first line of the script (options
like "-w").

Acknowledgement: this macro was in part inspired by Dean Povey's
AC_PROG_PERL_VERSION.

ax_sys_weak_alias
=================

Synopsis
********

     AX_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS

Description
***********

Determines whether weak aliases are supported on the system, and if so,
what scheme is used to declare them. Also checks to see if aliases can
cross object file boundaries, as some systems don't permit them to.

Most systems permit something called a "weak alias" or "weak symbol."
These aliases permit a library to provide a stub form of a routine
defined in another library, thus allowing the first library to operate
even if the other library is not linked. This macro will check for
support of weak aliases, figure out what schemes are available, and
determine some characteristics of the weak alias support - primarily,
whether a weak alias declared in one object file may be referenced from
another object file.

There are four known schemes of declaring weak symbols; each scheme is
checked in turn, and the first one found is prefered. Note that only one
of the mentioned preprocessor macros will be defined!

1. Function attributes

This scheme was first introduced by the GNU C compiler, and attaches
attributes to particular functions. It is among the easiest to use, and
so is the first one checked. If this scheme is detected, the
preprocessor macro HAVE_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS_ATTRIBUTE will be defined to 1.
This scheme is used as in the following code fragment:

       void __weakf(int c)
       {
         /* Function definition... */
       }

       void weakf(int c) __attribute__((weak, alias("__weakf")));

2. #pragma weak

This scheme is in use by many compilers other than the GNU C compiler.
It is also particularly easy to use, and fairly portable - well, as
portable as these things get. If this scheme is detected first, the
preprocessor macro HAVE_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS_PRAGMA will be defined to 1. This
scheme is used as in the following code fragment:

       extern void weakf(int c);
       #pragma weak weakf = __weakf
       void __weakf(int c)
       {
         /* Function definition... */
       }

3. #pragma _HP_SECONDARY_DEF

This scheme appears to be in use by the HP compiler. As it is rather
specialized, this is one of the last schemes checked. If it is the first
one detected, the preprocessor macro HAVE_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS_HPSECONDARY
will be defined to 1. This scheme is used as in the following code
fragment:

       extern void weakf(int c);
       #pragma _HP_SECONDARY_DEF __weakf weakf
       void __weakf(int c)
       {
         /* Function definition... */
       }

4. #pragma _CRI duplicate

This scheme appears to be in use by the Cray compiler. As it is rather
specialized, it too is one of the last schemes checked. If it is the
first one detected, the preprocessor macro
HAVE_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS_CRIDUPLICATE will be defined to 1. This scheme is
used as in the following code fragment:

       extern void weakf(int c);
       #pragma _CRI duplicate weakf as __weakf
       void __weakf(int c)
       {
         /* Function definition... */
       }

In addition to the preprocessor macros listed above, if any scheme is
found, the preprocessor macro HAVE_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS will also be defined
to 1.

Once a weak aliasing scheme has been found, a check will be performed to
see if weak aliases are honored across object file boundaries. If they
are, the HAVE_SYS_WEAK_ALIAS_CROSSFILE preprocessor macro is defined to
1.

This Autoconf macro also makes two substitutions. The first, WEAK_ALIAS,
contains the name of the scheme found (one of "attribute", "pragma",
"hpsecondary", or "criduplicate"), or "no" if no weak aliasing scheme
was found. The second, WEAK_ALIAS_CROSSFILE, is set to "yes" or "no"
depending on whether or not weak aliases may cross object file
boundaries.

Provides a test for the compiler support of thread local storage (TLS)
extensions. Defines TLS if it is found. Currently knows about GCC/ICC
and MSVC. I think SunPro uses the same as GCC, and Borland apparently
supports either.

     AX_TRY_COMPILE_JAVA

Description
***********

AX_TRY_COMPILE_JAVA attempt to compile user given source.

*Warning*: its success or failure can depend on a proper setting of the
CLASSPATH env. variable.

Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set, some macros depend
on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission. The
general documentation, as well as the sample configure.in, is included
in the AX_PROG_JAVA macro.

ax_upload
=========

Synopsis
********

     AX_UPLOAD([command])

Description
***********

Adds support for uploading dist files. %%s in the command will be
substituted with the name of the file. e.g:

       AX_UPLOAD([ncftpput -v upload.sourceforge.net /incoming %%s])

To add upload support for other custom dists add upload-<TYPE> to
UPLOAD_BIN or UPLOAD_SRC, where <TYPE> is the type of dist that is being
uploaded and add a mapping from <TYPE> to the dist file name in the
format '{<TYPE>=><FILENAME>}' to UPLOAD_TARGETS. For example:

       UPLOAD_BIN += upload-foobar
       UPLOAD_TARGETS += {foobar=>@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@.fb}

You can then upload of the src distribution files by running:

       make upload-src

all the binaru distribution files by running:

       make upload-bin

or both by running:

       make upload

     AX_VAR_TIMEZONE_EXTERNALS

Description
***********

Use instead of `AC_STRUCT_TIMEZONE' to determine whether the external
timezone variables `timezone', `altzone' and `daylight' exist, defining
`HAVE_TIMEZONE', `HAVE_ALTZONE' and `HAVE_DAYLIGHT' respectively (as
well as gaining the macros defined by `AC_STRUCT_TIMEZONE').

Rewritten for Autoconf 2.68, and made robust against BSD's timezone()
function, by Daniel Richard G.

ax_very_nice
============

Synopsis
********

     AX_VERY_NICE

Description
***********

A macro to check the options of nice, in order to have a VERY_NICE
variable which runs a program at the lowest priority VERY_NICE is
undefined if we don't find the proper options, so you can safely use:

       @VERY_NICE@ mycommand

in a shell script.

The VERY_NICE variable includes the placeholder NICE_VALUE that you have
to instantiate at run-time. If you give a argument to AX_VERY_NICE, it
will be used as an argument of nice for testing and included in
VERY_NICE instead of the above placeholder.
