* Noteworthy changes in release 2012.11.14 (2012-11-14) [stable]

  The portability of AX_BOOST_SYSTEM and AX_BOOST_THREAD has been improved. See
  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-archive-maintainers/2012-09/msg00026.html>
  for further details.

  AX_COUNT_CPUS has been cleaned up. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7860>
  for further details.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2012.09.08 (2012-09-08) [stable]

  AX_BLAS has been extended to detect the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL). See
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7807> for further details.

  Several bugs and inconsistencies in AX_TRY_RUN_JAVA, AX_PROG_JAVA_WORKS,
  AX_CHECK_CLASS, and AX_PROG_JAVA have been fixed. See
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7835> for further details.

  defines the strcasecmp() function. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7836>
  for further details.

  AX_LIB_ORACLE_OCCI has been added. The macro detects the availability of the
  Oracle OCCI API of particular version or newer. Further details can be found
  at <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7834>.

  AX_CHECK_POSTGRES_DB has been substantially re-written. The default behavior
  is unchanged, but there are two new (optional) arguments ACTION-IF-FOUND and
  ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7832> for further
  details.

  AX_CXX_RVALUE_REFERENCES has been added. See
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7833> for further details.

  AX_BLAS has been extended to support for the (free-software, BSD-licensed)
  OpenBLAS library, a descendant of GotoBLAS
  <http://xianyi.github.com/OpenBLAS/>. See
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7828> for further details.

  The reliability of AX_BOOST_SYSTEM and AX_BOOST_FILESYSTEM has been improved.
  See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7816> for further details.

  The new entry AX_ZONEINFO has been added. Further details are available at
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/index.php?7814>.

  AX_CHECK_ZLIB has been updated significantly:

   - The behavior was changed so that the macro proceeds to compile and link
     tests even if zlib.h was not found in the "usual locations".

   - The macro interface has been extend to the typical ([action-if-found],
     [action-if-not-found])-style.

   - Previous versions used to search zlib in "usual locations" only if
     --with-zlib was provided [by user]. Now, the macro performs that search in
     default mode, too.

  See <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-archive-maintainers/2012-07/msg00005.html>
  for further details.

  The new macro AX_PRINTF_SIZE_T has been added which can be used to check for

  can be found at
  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-archive-maintainers/2011-05/msg00004.html>,
  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-archive-maintainers/2011-06/msg00003.html>.

  AX_BOOST_THREAD: Two bugs have been fixed that prevented the macro from being
  used in cross-compilation environments for Windows on Unix.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2011.03.17 (2011-03-17) [stable]

  AX_PATH_GENERIC has been extended to allow setting LIBRARY_LIBS and
  LIBRARY_CFLAGS variables on configure command line or in the environment to
  override the normal values returned by `library-config --libs` and `--cflags`
  respectively. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7490> for further details.

  AX_LIB_EXPAT has been modified to save the found library in EXPAT_LIBS
  instead if EXPAT_LDFLAGS. This is necessary to avoid build failures when
  linking with --as-needed. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7489> for
  further details.

  AX_PKG_SWIG has been extended to find SWIG v2 as installed by Ubuntu Maverick
  and Ubuntu Natty.

  splint utility. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7453> for further
  details.

  Fixed a regression in AX_EXT_HAVE_LIB.

  The new macro AX_BERKELEY_DB_CXX has been added. It is a variant of
  AX_BERKELEY_DB that has been adapted to check for C++ headers and libraries.

  called several times. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7403> for further
  details.

  The new macro AX_CXX_RESTRICT_THIS has been added. It's purpose is to
  determine whether the C++ compiler supports qualifying a member function with
  a restricted "this" pointer. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7397> for
  further details.

  AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_0X has been improved to support GCC 4.5.x. Please refer
  to <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7387> for further details.

  The macro AX_GCC_OPTION has been marked obsolete and will be deleted from the
  archive in the foreseeable future. Its functionality is now provided by
  AX_C_CHECK_FLAG, AX_CXX_CHECK_FLAG, AX_CPP_CHECK_FLAG, AX_CXXCPP_CHECK_FLAG,
  and AX_LD_CHECK_FLAG.

  The license of the following macros has been updated from GPLv2 (with

  The macros AX_CXX_CPPFLAGS_STD_LANG, AX_CXX_CXXFLAGS_STD_LANG and
  AX_CXX_LDFLAGS_STD_LANG have been modified to use AX_COMPILER_VENDOR
  for compiler detection.

  The new macro AX_ASM_INLINE has been added. It's purpose is to determine
  whether the C compiler supports in-line assembler instructions.

  The new macro AX_FORCEINLINE has been added. It's purpose is to determine
  whether the C compiler supports forced in-lining.

  The new macro AX_LIB_CGAL_CORE has been added. Further details are available

* Noteworthy changes in release 2010.10.26 (2010-10-26) [stable]

  The macros AX_WITH_GUILE, AX_WITH_PERL, AX_WITH_PYTHON, and AX_WITH_RUBY are
  considered obsolete and will be deleted from the archive in the foreseeable
  future. Use of obsolete macros can be identified by running autoconf(1) with
  the flag -Wobsolete. Furthermore, the standard utility autoupdate(1) provides
  assistance with updating existing "configure.ac" files.

  AX_PROG_DOXYGEN has been extended to implement "DX_DOT_FEATURE(ON|OFF)". This
  feature was documented, but it didn't actually exist. Further details are
  available at <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7340>.

  A bug in AX_BOOST_BASE has been fixed that would cause BOOST_LDFLAGS to be
  detected incorrectly. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7337> for further
  details.

  AX_LIB_HDF5 has been extended to support requesting either a serial or a
  parallel HDF5 installation. Furthermore, the macro can now detect whether or
  not a Fortran-ready installation is present. Further details are available at
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7338>.

  AX_CFLAGS_WARN_ALL has been cleaned up to avoid use of obsolete Autoconf
  constructs. Also, a new variant of the macro, AX_FCFLAGS_WARN_ALL, has been
  added to enable support for Fortran. Further details are available at
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7335>.

  AX_COMPILER_VENDOR has been extended to support the Clang compiler.

  Caching issues in AX_BLAS have been remedied. Further details are available
  at <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7320>.

  Plenty of Autoconf 2.68 warnings have been fixed.

  Added initial version of AX_CC_FOR_BUILD.

  AX_LUA_LIB_VERSION has been renamed to AX_LUA_HEADERS_VERSION, because that
  is what the macro is checking, really. A new macro AX_LUA_READLINE has been
  added.

  The AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H macro has been improved to support the system shell
  "dash". See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7317> for further details.

  The AX_BLAS_F77_FUNC macro has been improved to properly save and restore the
  value of the $LIBS variable. Furthermore, an extra check was added to verify
  that the integer size of Fortran (4 or 8 bytes) matches that of BLAS. See
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7311> for further details.

  AX_TLS has been updated to usual FOUND/NOT-FOUND interface.

  Handling of indirectly named shell variables has been fixed in
  AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION. There have also been improvements to the

  64-bit support in the boost macros has been improved. Further details are at:
  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-archive-maintainers/2010-08/msg00008.html>.

  A test logic error in AX_LIB_MYSQL has been fixed. Further details are at
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7285>.

  The boost macros for iostreams, regex, serialization, signals, system,
  test_exec_monitor, unit_test_framework, wave, and wserialization have been
  patched not to rely on being executed by a 'bash' shell. Also, an
  under-quoted shell variable has been fixed in AX_BOOST_BASE.

  The documentation of AX_MPI has been improved. Further details are at
  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-archive-maintainers/2010-08/msg00000.html>.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2010.07.06 (2010-07-06) [stable]

  Fixed compiler warning in AX_PTHREAD's test program for AC_TRY_LINK.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2010.06.04 (2010-06-04) [beta]

  The Autoconf Archive has been declared an official GNU project. Consequently,
  the web site has moved from <http://www.nongnu.org/autoconf-archive/> to
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/>. Old addresses remain valid
  for the foreseeable future, though.

  AX_BOOST_DATE_TIME and AX_BOOST_FILESYSTEM have been patched to function
  correctly on systems that use "dash" as the system shell (i.e. Debian).

  AX_PTHREAD has been fixed to provide the "-pthreads" flag on 10.6 OS X
  systems.

  Fixed use of $EXEEXT in AX_CHECK_JAVA_HOME, AX_PROG_JAVA, AX_PROG_JAVA_WORKS,
  AX_PROG_JAVAC, and AX_PROG_JAVADOC. Further details can be found at
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?6948>.

  AX_LIB_LIBKML, a macro to detect Google's libkml library, has been added. See
  http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7109 for further details.

  AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H has been bug-fixed to avoid generating extraneous spaces
  that would break prefixed macros.

  AX_F90_MODULE_FLAG has been bug-fixed with regard to the Compaq Alpha Fortran
  compiler.

  A typo in the code of AX_PYTHON_EMBED has been fixed that resulted in the
  function AX_PYTHON_INSIST being undefined.

  The new AX_LIB_HDF5 macro provides functionality to detect the HDF5 library.

  The version detection code in AX_PKG_SWIG has been fixed. Previous versions
  of this macro would fail to accept SWIG 2.0 where SWIG >= 1.3.x was requested.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2010.02.14 (2010-02-14) [beta]

  All macros have been assigned a unique serial number that corresponds to the
  number of commits that have modified the macro in the Archive's Git
  repository. Refer to the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool//manual/automake/Serials.html][Automake documentation on serial numbers]] for further
  details about why these numbers are useful.

  The text of the all-permissive license has been augmented by an express
  warranty disclaimer as [[http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html][suggested by the Free Software Foundation]].

  AX_CXX_VERBOSE_TERMINATE_HANDLER has been generalized to support
  architectures other than GNU libstdc++.

  AX_CHECK_ICU has been extended to support icu-specific CPPFLAGS.

  AX_BOOST_BASE has been improved to work correctly in a cross-compilation
  environment and extended to support an
  ACTION-IF-FOUND/ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND-style API.

  AX_PTHREAD has been updated to succeed when compiling with -Wall and -Werror.

  AX_C_IFDEF has been deprecated, because the standard Autoconf macro
  AC_CHECK_DECL provides the same functionality.

  AX_C_PRINTF_THSEP has been deprecated because of technical flaws. See
  http://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6848 for further details.

  AX_RESTORE_FLAGS and AX_SAVE_FLAGS have been added.

  AX_SYS_LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE has improved support for x86_64 hosts.

  AX_MPIP has been added.

  In all macros, calls to the obsolete AC_HELP_STRING function have been
  replaced with the newer, recommended AS_HELP_STRING.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2009.12.16 (2009-12-16) [alpha]

  All macros that used a prefix other than AX_ -- or no prefix at all -- have
  been renamed to use AX_ consistently. The new version forward old calls under
  their old names to the new ones via Autoconf's AU_ALIAS mechanism.

  The HTML documentation is obsolete. Instead, the archive now ships its
  documentation in Texinfo format.

  All macros distributed by the archive are now licensed under terms that do
  *not* limit the choice of license for the generated configure script.
  Previous releases didn't meet this requirement because they contained macros
  that were licensed under GPL or Lesser GPL without an Autoconf Exception.

  Please refer to the [[ChangeLog]] file for a complete list of changes.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2009.07.31 (2009-07-31) [alpha]

  The archive has moved to Savannah: http://www.nongnu.org/autoconf-archive/
  Version 2009-04-26 was the last to be released at autoconf-archive.cryp.to.

  The version identifier has been changed to a "year.month.day" spelling,
  rather than the ISO format, because the dot-separated spelling works better
  for most distributions and for the gnulib infrastructure.

  The 2009.07.31 release was an internal test release that has never been
  publicly available.
